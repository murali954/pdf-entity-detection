This,is,the,most,complicated,and,unpredictable,method,of,the,three.,Its,
main,value,lies,in,the,fact,that,it,combines,the,driller's,and,engineer's,
methods,,so,that,kill,operation,may,be,initiated,immediately,upon,receipt,
of,the,shut-in,pressures.,Instead,of,waiting,until,all,the,surface,mud,has,
been,weighted,up,,pumping,begins,immediately,at,the,kill,rate,and,the,mud,
is,pumped,down,as,the,density,is,increased.,The,rate,at,which,the,mud,
density,is,raised,is,dependent,upon,the,mixing,facilities,available,and,the,
capability,of,the,crew.,The,main,complication,of,this,method,is,that,the,
drillpipe,can,be,filled,with,muds,of,different,densities,,making,calculation,
of,the,bottomhole,hydrostatic,pressure,(and,drillpipe,pressure),difficult.
