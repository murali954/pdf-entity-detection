Another,consideration,is,the,maximum,hookload,which,can,be,applied,
when,only,a,few,stands,of,the,higher,grade,pipe,have,been,added.,Provided,
the,higher,grade,pipe,is,in,the,vertical,section,,maximum,hookload,(pick-
up,load),is,calculated,as,the,yield,strength,of,the,lower,grade,of,pipe,PLUS,
the,“air,weight”,of,the,higher,grade,pipe.,This,is,because,the,surface,
hookload,includes,the,weight,of,the,higher,grade,pipe;,but,that,weight,
(since,it,is,supported,from,the,surface),does,not,act,on,the,top,joint,of,
lower,grade,pipe.
