The,operator,can,pull,230,937,pounds,over,the,hookload,before,reaching,
the,limit,of,elastic,deformation,(yield,strength).,Obviously,,as,depth,
increases,,hookload,increases,,at,a,certain,depth,the,hookload,will,equal,
the,yield,strength,(in,pounds),for,the,drill,pipe,in,use.,This,depth,can,be,
thought,of,as,the,maximum,depth,that,can,be,reached,without,causing,
permanent,elongation,of,the,drill,pipe,(disregarding,hole,drag,as,a,
consideration).,Practically,,an,operator,would,never,intend,to,reach,this,
limit.,A,considerable,safety,factor,is,always,included,to,allow,for,overpull,
caused,by,expected,hole,drag,,tight,hole,conditions,or,a,stuck,drillstring.
