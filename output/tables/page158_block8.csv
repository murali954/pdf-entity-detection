This,sinusoidal,buckling,formula,can,be,used,to,develop,graphs,and,tables,
(see,pages,4-18,through,4-23).,If,the,compressive,load,at,a,given,
inclination,lies,below,the,graph,,then,the,drill,pipe,will,not,buckle.,The,
reason,that,pipe,in,an,inclined,hole,is,so,resistant,to,buckling,is,that,the,
hole,is,supporting,and,constraining,the,pipe,throughout,its,length.,The,low,
side,of,the,hole,tends,to,form,a,trough,that,resists,even,a,slight,
displacement,of,the,pipe,from,its,initial,straight,configuration.
