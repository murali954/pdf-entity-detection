Because,tool,joints,are,added,to,drillpipe,,the,weight,of,given,to,pipe,in,
many,tables,is,the,“nominal,weight”.,The,exact,weight,will,require,adding,
the,weight,of,the,tool,joints,to,the,tubing,portion.,Since,two,joints,do,not,
weigh,the,same,,it,is,difficult,to,determine,the,weight,of,a,joint,of,drillpipe,
and,so,an,“approximate,weight”,is,used,in,many,calculations.
