Multi-lobe,motors,have,high,torque,output,and,relatively,slow,speed.,
Therefore,,they,have,good,applications,with,roller,cone,bits,and,for,coring.,
Such,motors,are,also,suitable,for,use,with,PDC,bits,,especially,the,large,
cutter,types,which,require,a,good,torque,output,to,be,efficient.,These,tools,,
being,fairly,short,,also,have,good,directional,applications,with,bent,subs,as,
the,deflection,device.,Multi-lobe,motors,may,be,constructed,with,a,hollow,
rotor,and,a,nozzle,or,blank,placed,in,a,holding,device,at,the,top.,The,nozzle,
allows,for,high,flow,rates,to,be,accommodated,by,by-passing,the,excess,
flow,from,the,motor,section,and,the,fluid,will,exit,through,the,bit.
