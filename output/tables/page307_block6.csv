The,second,indication,of,a,kick,,or,the,first,confirmation,that,a,
kick,is,taking,place,,is,an,increase,in,return,flowrate,at,the,
flowline.,Flow,of,formation,fluid,into,the,wellbore,will,cause,the,
return,flowrate,to,increase,,which,will,occur,concurrently,with,,
or,shortly,after,the,drill,break.,The,invading,fluid,is,normally,
lighter,than,the,mud,,so,continual,influx,will,lighten,the,mud,
column,and,further,reduce,bottomhole,pressure.,This,,in,turn,,
allows,the,influx,rate,to,increase.,Once,flow,begins,,the,rate,of,
increase,will,be,proportional,to,the,depth,of,penetration,into,the,
formation.
