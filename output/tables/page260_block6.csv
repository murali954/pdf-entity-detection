Most,steerable,systems,presently,being,used,are,based,on,a,positive,
displacement,motor,and,use,the,principles,of,tilting,the,axis,of,the,bit,with,
respect,to,the,axis,of,the,hole.,The,majority,of,directional,drilling,
companies,use,a,single-tilt,PDM,,with,a,bend,either,on,the,U-joint,housing,
or,at,the,connection,between,the,U-joint,housing,and,the,bearing,housing.,
Nowadays,this,single,bend,is,typically,adjustable,on,the,rig,floor,,enabling,
the,tilt,angle,to,be,set,at,any,value,between,zero,and,some,maximum.
