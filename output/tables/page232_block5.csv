of,directional,wells,during,rotary,drilling,by,correct,design,of,the,assembly,
and,use,of,suitable,drilling,parameters.,However,,the,control,of,hole,
direction,has,traditionally,been,poor.,Roller,cone,bits,usually,walk,to,the,
right,,and,directional,control,was,formerly,limited,to,using,well-stabilized,
assemblies,to,reduce,this,tendency.,Until,the,eighties,it,was,standard,
practice,to,give,wells,a,lead,angle,to,the,left,of,the,proposal,to,compensate,
