When,used,with,angle,drop,assemblies,,PDC,bits,can,reduce,the,drop,rate,
previously,obtained,with,a,tri-cone,bit.,Generally,,the,longer,the,gauge,
length,,the,lower,the,rate,of,drop,obtained,because,the,bit,gauge,acts,
similar,to,a,full,gauge,near-bit,stabilizer.,Short,gauge,length,PDCs,can,be,
used,effectively,for,dropping,angle.,When,such,a,suitable,PDC,bit,is,used,
in,a,rotary,pendulum,assembly,,the,low,WOB,and,high,RPM,,typical,to,
most,PDC,bit,applications,,should,assist,in,dropping,angle.
