By the 1940's, a much improved technique had been developed for the 
manufacture of diamond bits. The diamonds were cast in a matrix of 
tungsten carbide powder bonded together with a copper and nickel binder. 
This change permitted the use of more complex bit designs and diamond 
setting patterns. These changes resulted in the improved performance of 
diamond bits, and reduced the cost of the diamond bits as compared to 
roller cone bits. However, they still were ten to fifteen times the cost of 
roller bits, and therefore limited to a “last resort” item.
