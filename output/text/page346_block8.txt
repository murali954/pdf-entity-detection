The recent trend towards deeper and costlier wells has led to the 
development of rock bits which will stay in the hole longer, drill more 
footage, and eliminate expensive rig-time and excessive trips. As a result, 
ever-increasing numbers of rock bits types have become available, 
including may styles of roller cone and fixed cutter bits.
