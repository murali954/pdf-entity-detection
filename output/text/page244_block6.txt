The portion of the BHA from the bit to the first string stabilizer hangs like 
a pendulum and, because of its own weight, presses the bit towards the low 
side of the hole. The major design feature of a pendulum assembly is that 
there is either no near-bit stabilizer or an undergauge near- bit stabilizer. In 
most cases where a pendulum assembly is used, the main factor causing 
deviation is the force at the bit acting on the low side of the hole. The 
length of collars from the bit to the first string stabilizer (the “pendulum”) 
must not be allowed to bend too much towards the low side of the hole.
