In shallow water operations (300 - 500 ft.), well control is very similar to 
that on land, with respect to the circulating pressure. As water depths 
increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the desired drillpipe 
pressures (initial circulating pressure and final circulating pressure) due to 
the small choke line ID from the subsea BOP stack to the rig floor. A 
thorough understanding of choke line pressure drop (frictional pressure 
loss) is an important aspect of subsea well control.
