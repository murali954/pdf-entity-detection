Diamond bits require hydraulics equivalent to, or greater than other bits in 
order to stay clean and run cooler in softer, stickier formations. The smaller 
the diamond bit, the better it performs - mainly because of hydraulics. 
Since the cutting surface of a diamond bit runs very close to the formation, 
the cuttings move from the center of the hole across the face of the bit to 
the outside of the borehole. The larger the bit, the greater amount of 
cuttings to be moved across the face, which may result in partial clogging 
of the flow area and a decrease in penetration rate unless hydraulics are 
maintained at high energy levels.
