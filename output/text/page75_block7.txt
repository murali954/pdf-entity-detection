When the fluid level in the drillstring is below that of the annulus, a greater 
hydrostatic pressure will exist in the annulus, and fluid will tend to flow 
from the annulus up the drillstring. In this case, calculating flow 
distribution by equating frictional losses gives a calculated annular flow 
and surge pressure slightly higher than actually exists. Because this error is 
small and conservative, and because at present there is no reliable way of 
measuring the fluid level within the pipe, the practice of calculating flow 
distribution by equating internal and external pressure losses is generally 
accepted.
