45.
Write down a packed assembly which could be used to hold 
angle in the tangent section of a directional well. Assume the 
inclination angle is in the range 45° - 50° and that the 12¼” hole 
section is being drilled. Indicate the gauge of all stabilizers. 
Suggest possible drilling parameters, assuming you are drilling 
medium hardness formation. State whether a PDC or roller cone 
bit is to be used.
