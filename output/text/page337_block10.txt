An influx of formation fluid or increase in annular pressure may cause the 
drillstring to become deferentially stuck. Pipe movement (if possible) 
should be made carefully. In the event of a kick, the well must be 
controlled first. Only after the well is brought under control should 
drillstring recovery operations be initiated.
