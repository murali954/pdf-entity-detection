For directional work with a bent sub, PDMs offer several advantages over 
turbines. When drilling with a PDM, the directional driller can use pump 
pressure as a weight indicator. If the pump pressure is constant, the 
differential pressure across the PDM is constant, so torque and WOB are 
constant. It is also much easier to tell if a PDM has stalled because there 
will be an immediate increase in surface pressure. PDMs give a longer bit 
life than turbines because of the slower rotary speed. They can tolerate 
LCM whereas turbines cannot. Finally, instead of using a bent sub, a PDM 
with a small bend at the U-joint housing can be used. As this bend is nearer 
to the bit, a smaller angle of bend will have the same effect as a larger bent 
sub angle. This reduces the problem of the bit riding the side of the hole 
while tripping in and out.
