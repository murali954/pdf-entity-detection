On multi-well projects (particularly offshore) there are small distances 
between slots. To eliminate the risk of collisions directly beneath the 
platform, the proposed well path is compared to existing and other 
proposed wells. The distances between the other wells and the proposal are 
calculated at frequent intervals in critical sections. These calculations can 
be performed using the EC*TRAK software (BHI) or COMPASS.
