As stated earlier, the drive stages, or motor section, consists of a series of 
stators and rotors of a bladed design. This stator and rotor combination 
form a stage. Turbines are referred to as 90 stage, 250 stage, etc. The 
number of stages determines the torque generated. Each stage, 
theoretically, applies an equal amount of torque to the control shaft and it is 
the sum of those torques which will be output to the bit.
