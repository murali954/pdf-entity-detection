The difference between the two is based on the relationship between the 
string weight and the formation pressure acting upon it. If the resultant 
upward force exerted by the kick acting on the string is greater than the 
weight of the string, the pipe will have to be snubbed into the hole. That is, 
pressure will have to be applied to the string to run it in. If the string weight 
is greater than the upward forces, the string is stripped in.
