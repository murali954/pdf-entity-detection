Additional WOB and RPM considerations must be kept in mind. A very 
high rotary speed can drastically reduce the life of many roller cone bits, 
thereby increasing their cost per foot (because of the cost of extra bits and 
extra trips). Similarly, running excessively high weight-on-bit may buckle 
the drill pipe as well as damage the bit, and will almost certainly cause 
problems because of excessive drilling torque. It would be best, therefore, 
to use values of WOB and rotary speed corresponding to the top end of the 
linear portions of the previous graph. The actual values of WOB and RPM 
at the point at which the graph departs from linearity depends on the type 
of bit and the hardness of the formation (as well as on the efficiency of the 
hydraulics in cleaning the bit and the bottom of the hole).
