Pumping is continued, holding the drillpipe pressure constant by adjusting 
the choke. When the kick fluids have been displaced, and further volume 
has been displaced equal to the pipe volume, the SIDP should be zero. The 
kick should be killed and the well checked for flow. Further circulations 
can be performed to condition the hole and to add any trip margin. Figure 
8-6 shows the variations in drillpipe and casing pressures as the kill 
procedure is implemented.
