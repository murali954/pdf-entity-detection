A unique bearing assembly and improved elastomer compounds in the 
stator have increased the Mach 1C’s hydraulic horsepower and extended 
operating life. It also has a new rotor nozzling system that allows the motor 
to be run at 50-100% over its maximum recommended flow rate without 
exceeding maximum recommended motor speed. The additional mud 
passes through the motor’s rotor, and flow rate can be adjusted by 
interchanging nozzles. Higher rates offer improved hole cleaning and bit 
hydraulics.
