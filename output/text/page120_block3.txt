As with the journal angle, the offset will be different in each type of 
formation. In soft formation bits, the maximum offset (3o skew angle) is 
used to increase the gouging, scraping action. Medium formation bits add a 
limited offset (2o skew angle) to develop cutter action. While hard 
formation bits have no offset, to minimize gouging and scraping.
