Jet circulation bits (Figure 3-3b), are manufactured with smooth, 
streamlined, fluid passageways in the dome of the bit. Drilling fluid passes 
through the bore of the bit at high velocities with minimum pressure losses, 
through the jet nozzles, and then to the hole bottom to flush cuttings away 
from the bit and up the hole. Excess fluid that impinges on the hole bottom 
flows up and around the cutters for cutter cleaning.
