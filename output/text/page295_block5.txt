These are naturally occurring bentonitic shales, generally known as 
“gumbo shales”. The clays within the shales react with the mud filtrate and 
hydrate. The hydrated shales will then fall or swell into the borehole. When 
drilling, the bit tends to “ball-up” with these clays. When tripping, the 
BHA can become stuck in the smaller diameter (swelled) portions of the 
borehole. Preventive measures include:
