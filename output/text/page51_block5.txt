The primary fluid loss agent in most water based muds are the clays. These 
solids should have a size variation with a large percentage being under 1 
micron. This will produce a filter cake with low porosity and permeability. 
The use of centrifuges or cyclone solids removal equipment may cause 
filtration problems by removing the small size solids. Starch is also used as 
a fluid loss agent, the starch being treated is so that it will easily gelatinize 
and swell. Water soluble polymers are commonly used as viscosifiers, 
acting on the fluid phase which also reduces fluid loss.
