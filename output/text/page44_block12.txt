The plastic viscosity (PV) is calculated by measuring the shear rate and 
stress of the fluid. These values are derived by using a Fann viscometer, 
which is a rotating-sleeve viscometer, and may be a simple hand operated 
two speed model or a more complex variable speed electric model. The two 
speed model operates at 300 and 600 rpm.
