Steerable turbines use the side force method by having an eccentric (or 
offset) stabilizer at the lower end of the bearing section (at the bottom end) 
of the turbine body, quite close to the bit. The three blade version shown 
below is the one most commonly used, but a single blade version exists and 
is used if a lot of drag (friction) is anticipated.
