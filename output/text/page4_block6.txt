IN-FACTS is structured to provide an easily understood, orderly flow of learning 
experiences. These may or may not be in the same specialty, and allow our personnel to 
concentrate in one area, or to branch out into other disciplines. Movement through the IN-
FACTS career progression is determined by industry experience, skills, and knowledge 
acquired through rigsite work and a variety of formal and informal training programs.
