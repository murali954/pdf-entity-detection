Drilling fluids are generally Non-Newtonian in behavior, and are defined 
by more complex relationships between shear-stress and shear-rate. When 
fluids contains colloidal particles (or clays), these particles tend to increase 
the shear-stress or force necessary to maintain a given flow rate. This is due 
to electrical attraction between particles and to them physically “bumping” 
into each other. Long particles, randomly oriented in a flow stream, will 
display high interparticle interference. However, as shear-rate is increased, 
the particles will tend to develop an orderly orientation and this interaction 
will decrease.
