In the 1980's, as horizontal drilling, high inclination extended reach wells 
and deep hole drilling applications increased, so has the demand for high 
strength drill pipe. It is common in deep hole applications for high strength 
drill pipe to be utilized in the upper portion of the string to keep the tension 
load within the capabilities of the steel. In high dogleg environments, such 
as those encountered in medium and short radius horizontal wells, high 
strength drill pipe can withstand the associated bending stresses. In high 
inclination and horizontal wells, high strength drill pipe is also commonly 
run in compression. One drawback of higher grades of steel is that they are 
generally less resistant to corrosion, like that caused by hydrogen sulfide 
(H2S). Limited availability also contributes to the higher cost.
