Loss of returns while trying to kill a kick can develop in underground 
blowouts. If a kick is impending or an underground blowout has started, a 
barite plug may be effective in isolating the thief zone from the kick. In 
addition, fine sealing material may be used to control slow losses (coarse 
material that may plug the bit, choke valve or choke line should not be 
used). Occasionally, a coarse sealing fluid may be used when bullheading 
down the annulus. Normally, the lost circulation zone should be sealed 
once the loss zone has been isolated from the influx zone.
