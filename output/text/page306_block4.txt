Lost Circulation: Raising the mud density to a value that exceeds the 
lowest fracture pressure, for fear of a kick, is not nearly as prevalent as it 
was in the 40's or 50's. A kick may still occur during drilling, but it is more 
likely to be due to fracturing a formation of lower pore pressure than an 
abnormally pressured zone. Rather than setting casing after drilling 
through a geopressured zone, the mud density is kept high to balance these 
formations. If the pore pressure decreases significantly, those lower 
pressured formations become susceptible to fracturing. If fracturing occurs, 
the fluid level in the annulus may drop due to lost circulation and the 
resulting loss in hydrostatic pressure may allow an influx of formation 
fluids, resulting in a kick. The existence of an abnormally pore pressured 
zone and a lost circulation zone in the same hole section are ingredients for 
a kick. The utmost care combined with diligent observation are necessary 
to successfully drill this type of well.
