Hole conditions may make it necessary to slack off more weight, but 
caution should be used in this respect since excessive weight-on-bit will 
shorten its life. Formations which drill by a chipping action produce an 
impact load against the diamonds. Drilling weight should be increased in 
increments of 2,000 pounds until increases in weight does not show a 
comparable increase in the penetration rate. When this occurs, the weight 
should be decreased to the lowest weight at which the best penetration rate 
was obtained.
