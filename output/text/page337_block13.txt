If the bit becomes completely plugged, drillpipe pressure cannot be used to 
maintain a constant bottomhole pressure and the casing pressure will 
increase slowly as gas percolates up the annulus. The casing pressure 
should be allowed to rise 100 psi above the initial SICP and small amounts 
of fluid should be bled off into a tank to monitor fluid volume. The 
procedures for a migrating gas bubble are then followed. Consideration 
may be given to running a string shot or perforating to regain circulation.
