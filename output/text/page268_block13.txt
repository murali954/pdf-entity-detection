The stabilizer is most commonly run directly above the motor. According 
to the 3-point geometry, increasing “L” (by moving the first string 
stabilizer higher in the BHA) reduces the Theoretical Geometric Dogleg 
Severity. This does not always work in practice. It has been found that 
moving the stabilizer higher can make it harder to get away from vertical in 
a kick-off. However, once some inclination has been achieved, the rate of 
build is often greater than the TGDS. For flat turns or for dropping angle, 
increasing “L” does reduce the dogleg rate as theory predicts.
