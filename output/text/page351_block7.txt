Cost per foot calculations can also be used in generating performance 
proposals for clients. A target cost per foot can be calculated based on 
information from offset well performance that used competitor products. 
This target cost per foot is underwritten by Baker Hughes INTEQ by 
applying a sliding-scale hourly rate for motor operations. If the target is 
met or exceeded, the motor is charged at normal list price; if it is not, then 
the hourly rate is adjusted downwards (to an agreed minimum) until the 
target figure is reached. This type of proposal has been used several times 
to persuade clients to run INTEQ motors.
