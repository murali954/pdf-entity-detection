A unique bearing assembly and improved elastomer compounds have 
increased the Mach 1 P/HFâ€™s hydraulic horsepower and extended its 
operating life. The rotor/stator design allows a larger than normal flow rate 
to be pumped through the motor, generating the higher torques. There is a 
rotor nozzling system that allows the motor to run over the higher
