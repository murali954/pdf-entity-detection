Recognition of kicks during connections requires careful monitoring of the 
return flow sensor. After the pumps have been shut down, the flow sensor 
should indicate an absolute “no flow” condition. However, on some rigs a 
long sloping flowline may cause mud to slowly trickle down after the 
pumps have been shut down. If this is the case, an increase above this slow 
trickle will indicate a kick. Also, a record of flowline mud density will 
disclose small mud cuts caused after connections, and may be accompanied 
by connection gases, but connection gases alone are not an indication of a 
kick during a connection.
