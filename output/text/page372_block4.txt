Collect and evaluate the plots/prints for the report: Study these 
plots/prints and be certain they are helpful to the reader, also do 
they illustrate what you want to say, and are they labeled 
properly. Indicate in the outline the size of each plot (i.e. 8.5 x 
11, 8.5 x 17, etc.). Recheck the number of plots/prints in the 
report; are there too many, not enough, located in the wrong part 
of the section, etc.
