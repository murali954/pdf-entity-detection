The Standard Removable Whipstock is mainly used to kick off wells, but 
can also be used for sidetracking. It consists of a long inverted steel wedge 
which is concave on one side to hold and guide the drilling assembly. It is 
also provided with a chisel point at the bottom to prevent the tool from 
turning, and a heavy collar at the top to withdraw the tool from the hole. It 
will usually be used with a drilling assembly consisting of a bit, a spiral 
stabilizer, and an orientation sub, rigidly attached to the whipstock by 
means of a shear pin.
