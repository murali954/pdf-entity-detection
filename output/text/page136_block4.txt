Low penetration rates with roller cone bits: Frequently, when roller 
cone bits drill at slow rates (especially 5 ft/hr or less), due to high mud 
weights or limited rig hydraulics, diamond bits can provide a savings. 
The “plowing” type cutting action of diamond bits generally produces 
higher penetration rates when using heavy muds. Since the drilling 
fluid is distributed between the bit face and the formation in a smooth 
uniform sheet, it takes less hydraulic horsepower per square inch to 
clean under a diamond bit than under the same size roller cone bit.
