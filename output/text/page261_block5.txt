As illustrated in Figure 5-56, one blade is larger in surface area and is 
offset by 1/8-inch. When the drill string is rotated, the offset stabilizer has 
no effect on the well path. When it is desired to deflect the well path, the 
toolface (the point opposite the center of the offset blade) is orientated 
using an MWD tool. Drilling continues with no rotation from surface and 
the turbine drills a curved path.
