Pressure is required to force the fluid over the face of the bit at velocities 
high enough to provide adequate cooling and cleaning. When the bit is off 
bottom, the fluid has a nearly unrestricted flow, but on bottom, the fluid 
must pass through a small area made up of fluid courses in the bit and the 
hole itself (clearance is the space between the bit matrix and the 
formation). This results in an off-on bottom pressure difference in a range 
of 100 to 1,000 psi depending on the total fluid area and operating 
conditions (mud density, bit weight, pump pressure, etc.).
