One argument for using a soft shut-in is that it reduces the water-hammer 
effect of abruptly stopping fluid flow, and it provides an alternative means 
of well control should the casing pressure become excessive. The primary 
argument against the soft shut-in is that a continuous influx occurs while 
the shut-in procedures are executed.
