A third type of circulation medium is compressed air or gas, and can be 
used with either regular or jet circulation bits. Bits manufactured for air or 
gas circulation have special passageways from the bore of the bit to the 
bearings, through which a portion of the air or gas is diverted to keep the 
bearings cool and purged of dust or cuttings. From the special passageways 
to the bearings, the air or gas passes through a number of strategically 
located ports or holes in the bearing journal, flows through the bearing 
structure and exhausts at the shirttail and gauge of the bit, to flow up the 
annulus.
