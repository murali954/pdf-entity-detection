Pressure surges can be detrimental to these sealed systems. As pressure and 
temperature increase, the viscosity of the lubricant increases. As a result, 
the system cannot instantaneously compensate for abrupt changes in 
pressure due to surges (going into the hole, making connections, etc.) and 
small quantities of mud invade the system. With the close tolerance 
necessary for effective sealing, mud solids can be damaging.
