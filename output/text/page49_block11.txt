These two properties shall be dealt with together, as it is the filtration of 
mud that causes the build up of filter cake. Loss of fluid (usually water and 
soluble chemicals) from the mud to the formation occurs when the 
permeability is such that it allows fluid to pass through the pore spaces. As 
fluid is lost, a build up of mud solids occurs on the face of the wellbore. 
This is the filter cake.
