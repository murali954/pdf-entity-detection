Pipe rams: These have semi-circular openings that match 
the diameter of the pipe being used. A drillstring comprising 
different pipe sizes, such as 3-inch and 5-inch drill pipe, 
would require two sets of pipe rams to accommodate both 
sizes of pipe. These are also operated hydraulically, and 
close around the tubing portion of drill pipe when used.
