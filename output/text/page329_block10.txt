This will occur when the kill mud reaches the choke line. Yet again, this 
pressure can be reduced by circulating at a slower rate or by using both the 
choke and kill lines. If the slow circulation rate was taken using the lowest 
optimum rate with the rig pumps, it may be necessary to use the cementing 
pump to circulate at a lower rate. Obviously, a slow circulation rate must 
be taken with the cementing unit prior to this!
