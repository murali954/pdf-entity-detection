The Mach 2 has a multi-stage, 1/2 rotor/stator configuration, which 
generates low to medium torque at medium speeds for higher penetration 
rates with less weight-on-bit. This makes it a good choice for drilling 
straight and directional holes in difficult formations. The motor is 
particularly suited for long-interval performance drilling with natural 
diamond, TSP, or PDC bits.
