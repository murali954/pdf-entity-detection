If geopressured formations are causing stuck pipe problems, great care 
must be taken to ensure well control problems do not develop. The first 
step in correcting the situation is to establish circulation. If possible, pipe 
movement should be downwards, gradually increasing these applied 
forces. Once full circulation is established and pipe movement is 
unrestricted, an increase in the mud density is advisable.
