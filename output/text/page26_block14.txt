These mud systems are “dispersed” with deflocculants and filtrate 
reducers. Normally used on deeper wells or where problems with viscosity 
occur. The main dispersed mud is a “lignosulfonate” system, though other 
products are used. Lignite and other chemicals are added to maintain 
specific mud properties.
