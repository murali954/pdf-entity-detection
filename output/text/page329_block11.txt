As stated earlier, kicks occurring while drilling from a floating rig will 
usually give higher surface pressures due to the length of choke line. Also, 
only a small portion of kick fluid will be required to completely fill the 
choke line and because the surface pressure is then dependent upon the 
length of the kick, it becomes increasingly important to detect kicks as 
rapidly as possible in deepwater drilling. It is vitally important that return 
flow sensors be as accurate as possible to provide this earliest warning.
