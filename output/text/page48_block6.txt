Gels are described as progressive/strong or fragile/weak. For a drilling 
fluid, the fragile gel is more desirable. In this case, the gel is initially quite 
high but builds up with time only slightly. This type of gel is usually easily 
broken and would require a lower pump pressure to break circulation.
