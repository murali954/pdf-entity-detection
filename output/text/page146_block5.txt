Drill pipe and collars are designed to satisfy certain operational 
requirements. In general, downhole tubulars must have the capability to 
withstand the maximum expected hookload, torque, bending stresses, 
internal pressure, and external collapse pressure. Operational capabilities 
of different sizes and grades of drill pipe and collars are tabulated in the 
API RP 7G to assist the drilling engineer in selection of pipe and collars for 
a given drilling situation. Other concerns, such as the presence of H2S, 
must also be considered in the selection process.
