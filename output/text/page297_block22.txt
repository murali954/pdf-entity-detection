If borehole geometry problems are suspected when tripping in, a gradual 
upwards working force should be applied. If this occurs when tripping out, 
upwards forces should be applied gradually to prevent the drillstring from 
further jamming. If a ledge is suspected, then a combination of upward/
downward forces should be used to try and remove the ledge.
