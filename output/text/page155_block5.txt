One important consideration in designing the BHA is determining the 
number of drill collars and heavy-weight pipe required to provide the 
desired weight-on-bit. When drilling vertical wells, standard practice is to 
avoid putting ordinary drill pipe into compression (recommended by 
Lubinski in 1950). This is achieved by making sure that the “buoyed 
weight” of the drill collars and heavy-weight pipe exceed the maximum 
weight-on-bit. This practice has also been adopted on low inclination, 
directionally drilled wells.
