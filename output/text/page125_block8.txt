Journal bearing systems in the tungsten carbide insert bits features a metal 
bearing surface combined with a hardfaced journal and a lubricant. 
Specialized seals and reliable pressure equalization systems keeps the 
drilling fluid and formation contaminants out of bearings, and positively 
seals the graphite-based lubricant inside the bearing. Precision fit of the 
journal and cone distributes contact loading evenly throughout a near-
perfect arc. Bearing surfaces are finished to a carefully controlled surface 
texture to ensure optimum lubrication.
