In certain cases, it may be necessary to allow the well to blowout in a 
controlled manner rather than be shut-in. This is common in shallow 
sections due to insufficient casing to contain a kick. In these circumstances, 
a diverter system will be used. This is a relatively low pressure system, 
often using the annular preventer to seal off the annulus below the flow 
line. The diverter line will then be opened below the annular preventer to 
allow the flow to be directed away from the rig.
