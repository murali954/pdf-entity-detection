Kicks that occur while running liner can be handled in a similar manner to 
a kick that occurs while drilling. If the liner is near bottom, an attempt 
should be made to strip into the hole. The kick can then be circulated out, 
the hole conditioned and the liner cemented in place. In some cases it may 
be necessary to strip the liner back into the casing shoe to prevent the liner 
from sticking. The annular pressure can be reduced by bullheading heavy 
drilling fluid into the well to overbalance the kick pressure, but when 
running of more liner into the hole, it may displace some of the heavy fluid 
and may start the well flowing again. In addition, pumping high density 
fluid into the annulus may result in lost circulation problems. Once the kick 
is killed, the liner should be tripped out and the hole conditioned for 
rerunning the liner. If the liner has not been run to the shoe, an attempt 
should be made to strip to the shoe, but not into the open hole.
