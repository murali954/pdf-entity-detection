This is an uncontrolled flow of formation fluids from a high pressure zone 
into a lower pressure zone. The loss of drill pipe pressure with changes in 
annular pressure, the loss of large volumes of drilling fluid, or the total loss 
of drilling fluid returns, characterizes underground blowouts. A common 
cause is the fracturing of formations below the casing shoe by excessive 
annular pressures. If the flow is not too severe, it may be possible to pump 
LCM in a light fluid, or a “gunk squeeze” down the annulus while killing 
the high pressure zone down the drillpipe with heavy mud.
