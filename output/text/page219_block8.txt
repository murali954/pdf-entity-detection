The “Permanent Casing Whipstock” (Figure 5-26) is designed to remain 
permanently in the well. It is used where a “window” is to be cut in casing 
for a sidetrack. The casing whipstock can be set using a Baker Model “D” 
Packer. A special stinger at the base of the whipstock slips into the packer 
assembly, and a stainless steel key within the packer locks the whipstock's 
anchor-seal and prohibits any circular movement during drilling.
