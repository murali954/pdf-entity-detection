This average velocity equation remains valid even when hole geometry 
changes. This method is easy to apply and is in widespread use in the 
oilfield. Its basic premise, that fluid levels in the drillstring and annulus 
remain equal, is rarely justified. Because of the greater restrictions to flow, 
caused by the bit nozzles and pipe bore, actual flow in the annulus will 
nearly always exceed that calculated by this method. Calculated swab and 
surge pressures are therefore usually too low.
