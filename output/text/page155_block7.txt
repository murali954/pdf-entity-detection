On highly deviated wells, operators have been running drillpipe in 
compression for years. Analysis of drillpipe buckling in inclined wells, by 
a number of researchers (most notably Dawson and Paslay), has shown that 
drillpipe can tolerate significant levels of compression in small diameter, 
high inclination boreholes. This is because of the support provided by the 
“low-side” of the borehole.
