In other types of directional wells, it must be remembered that since gravity 
acts vertically, only the weight of the “along-hole” component of the BHA 
elements will contribute to the weight-on-bit. The problem this creates is 
that if high WOB is required when drilling a high inclination borehole, a 
long (and expensive) BHA would be needed to prevent putting the drillpipe 
into compression. However, for these high inclination wells, it is common 
practice to use about the same BHA weight as used on low inclination 
wells.
