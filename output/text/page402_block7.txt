Never let the drilled wellpath get too far from the planned 
trajectory, because “drilling on the line” can be significantly 
more expensive. As surveys are obtained, calculate and plot 
the position on both horizontal and vertical plans. At all 
times there must be a feasible course to drill from the 
current location to the intended target.
