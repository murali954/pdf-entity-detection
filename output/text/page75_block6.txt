When tripping out of the hole, it may be assumed that both drillstring and 
annulus are kept full of fluid. The required distribution of flow is that 
which gives equal frictional losses in the pipe bore and annulus. When 
tripping into the hole, the fluid level inside the drillstring can drop well 
below that in the annulus, if small bit nozzles are present. This effect is 
usually seen as a pit volume being higher than expected, string weight 
lower than expected, and a considerable volume being pumped before 
standpipe pressure builds up while breaking circulation.
