These are most useful when running casing through a high fluid-loss 
drilling fluid. There are two types of wall scratchers, rotating scratchers 
used when the casing can be rotated (normally in vertical wells), and 
reciprocating scratchers used when the pipe is reciprocated (moved up and 
down). When these scratchers are placed in 15 to 20 foot intervals, 
overlapping cleaning occurs.
