This is defined as pumping fluid into the well without circulation back to 
the surface. The fluid can be pumped down the drillpipe, down the annulus, 
or both. In most instances this will result in formation fracturing. This will 
occur at the weakest point, which is usually the formation near the last 
casing shoe. Obviously, in underground blowouts or wells with lost 
circulation, bullheading can prove useful since the fracture or loss zone 
already exists.
