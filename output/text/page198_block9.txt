Experience over the years has shown that directional control problems are 
aggravated when tangent inclinations are less than 15°. This is because 
there is more tendency for the bit to walk (i.e. change in azimuth) so more 
time is spent keeping the well on course. As such, most run-of-the-mill 
directional wells are still planned with inclinations in the range 15° - 60°.
