The direction of fluid flow is an important concern when choosing a 
control procedure. The cause of the blowout will often indicate the 
direction of flow. If the cause is thought to be the fracturing of a formation 
due to shutting in a kick, the direction of fluid flow will generally be 
upward (assuming that shallow zones are more likely to fracture than 
deeper zones and that the initial kick zone is the primary source of 
formation fluid).
