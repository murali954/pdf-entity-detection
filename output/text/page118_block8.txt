One advantage of a rolling cutter bits is the three bearing design located 
around the journal of the bit. Heel bearings are roller bearings, which carry 
most of the load and receive most of the wear. Middle bearings are ball 
bearings, which hold the cone on the journal and resist thrust in either 
direction. The nose bearing consists of a special case hardened bushing 
pressed into the nose of the cone and a male piece, hard faced with a 
special material, to resist seizure and wear.
