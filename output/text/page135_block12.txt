Diamond bits are sold by the carat weight (1 carat = 0.2 grams) of the 
diamonds in the bit, plus a setting charge. The price will vary depending 
upon classification (or quality) and size. The setting charge is to cover the 
manufacturing cost of the bit. A used bit is generally returned to salvage 
the diamonds and to receive credit for the reusable stones (which 
materially decreases the bit cost). This credit is frequently as much as 50% 
of the original bit cost.
