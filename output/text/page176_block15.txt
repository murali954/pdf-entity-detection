These programs have a wide range of applications, but have mainly been 
used to evaluate drillstring design integrity and alternative well plans for 
horizontal wells or complex, unusual directional wells. However, the 
program can be used to check BHA weight calculations for normal 
directional wells. The program will calculate axial drag for a non-rotated 
assembly and also calculates the position of the neutral point in the 
drillstring. In addition, the program calculates the forces on the drill pipe 
and will “flag” any values of compressive load which exceed the critical 
buckling force for the drill pipe.
