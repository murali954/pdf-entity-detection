Some elementary texts on directional drilling depict the pendulum effect as 
shown in Figure 5-42. The implication being that part of the dropping 
tendency is produced by a downward tilt of the bit axis. It is interesting to 
note that if this picture were true then the dropping tendency would be 
increased by increasing WOB and reducing rotary speed, the precise 
opposite of what is recommended.
