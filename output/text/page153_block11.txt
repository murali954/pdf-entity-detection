The air weight of the higher grade pipe is used because the buoy force 
acting on the drillstring is acting on the bit and components of the BHA. 
The hydrostatic pressure which the mud exerts on the drill pipe in the upper 
(vertical) section of the hole does not create a resultant force acting 
upwards.
