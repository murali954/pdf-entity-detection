The borehole is seldom drilled in a smooth manner. Ledges and washouts 
are common, especially when alternating hard/soft formations are drilled. 
Problems with borehole geometry normally occur during tripping 
operations. Remember, when tripping in, the drillstring is in compression 
making it more flexible. When tripping out, the drillstring is in tension 
making it more rigid. Preventive measures include:
