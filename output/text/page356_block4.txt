Based on local drilling conditions and the expertise of wellsite personnel, it 
is possible to estimate with reasonable accuracy either the hours which can 
be expected or the probable penetration rate. If probable hours are 
estimated, this value can be found along the breakeven line and a 
horizontal reading on the footage scale indicates the required footage to 
breakeven.
