If the cuttings are of irregular shape (and most are) they are subjected to a 
torque caused by the shearing of the mud. If the drillpipe is rotating, a 
centrifugal effect causes the cuttings to move towards the outer wall of the 
annulus. The process is further complicated because the viscosity of non-
Newtonian fluids varies according to the shear rate, and therefore the 
velocity of the cutting changes with radial position. Finally, transport rates 
are strongly dependent on cutting size and shape, which as stated above, 
are both irregular and variable.
