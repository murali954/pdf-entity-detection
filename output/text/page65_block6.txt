Cuttings will travel up the annulus more efficiently if they travel flat and 
horizontally. If the cutting turns on its edge, it will slip more easily. 
Smaller cuttings are more prone to do this. Rotation of the drillpipe will 
result in a helical motion of the fluid, which will aid transport for those 
cuttings nearest the pipe.
