Older rigs may not have a trip tank, so reliance for volume checks is placed 
on monitoring one of the active pits and pump strokes. PVT monitoring 
provides a necessary cross-check, but because of the large surface area of 
the active pits, precision may be limited. The mud pumps are a reasonably 
efficient displacement monitor at low pressures and stroke-rates, and pump 
strokes are often used to measure the amount of fluid displaced, while 
tripping out. It is normal for the hole to take slightly more mud than the 
volume of the pipe removed, due to static filtration into the formation.
