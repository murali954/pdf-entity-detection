Once the well is shut-in, it is necessary to calculate the kill mud density, 
initial and final circulating pressures, and the kick fluid gradient. If the kick 
fluid is gas, the bubble may start to percolate up the annulus. (this will 
cause a slow rise in the pressures on both drillpipe and casing). If the 
pressures begin to rise, a small amount of fluid can be bled from the choke, 
to release this “trapped pressure”. This process should be repeated until the 
drillpipe pressure has stabilized.
