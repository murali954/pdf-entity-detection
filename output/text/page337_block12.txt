If one or more bit jets become plugged, the SIDP will increase suddenly 
while a constant pump rate is maintained. The choke should not be opened 
to maintain a constant drillpipe pressure, as this will allow the influx of 
more fluid. The pump should be stopped and the well shut in. The SPR 
should be redetermined and this new pressure maintained as the pumps are 
brought up to the new slow circulating rate, without encountering 
excessive drill pipe pressures. These new pressures should be used to 
continue the kill operation.
