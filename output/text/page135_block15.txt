Very short roller cone bit life: If roller cone bit life is very short due to 
bearing failure, tooth wear, or tooth breakage, a diamond bit can 
increase on-bottom time dramatically. Diamond bits have no bearings 
and each diamond has a compressive strength of 1,261,000 psi 
(approximately 1.5 times that of sintered tungsten carbide). The
