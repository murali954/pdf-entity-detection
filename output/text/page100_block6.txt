The black top plug has a deep cup on its top and has a solid, molded rubber 
core. It is dropped after the cement slurry has been pumped, to prevent 
contamination with the displacement fluid. The top plug also signals the 
end of displacement by forming a seal on top of the bottom plug, causing a 
pressure increase.
