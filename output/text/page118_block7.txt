The primary drilling mechanism of the rolling cutter bits is intrusion, 
which means that the teeth are forced into the rock by the weight-on-bit, 
and pulled through the rock by the rotary action. For this reason, the cones 
and teeth of rolling cuttings rock bits are made from specially, case 
hardened steel.
