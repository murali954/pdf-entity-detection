Historical shapes of milled teeth have built up a mystique about insert tooth 
shape. Many people in the oil field thought that chisel shaped teeth 
significantly affected the drill rate in all formations. This was because early 
drilling practices used light bit weights, causing the relatively sharp chisel 
shaped inserts to have a higher unit loading on the formation, hence faster 
drill rates. When heavier bit weights are used, it tends to nullify the 
advantage of the chisel shape. Even the steel milled teeth break down under 
heavy weights. In fact, most bits drill 75% of the hole in a 1/2 to 3/4 dull 
condition. With this in mind, many “blunt” insert tooth designs were made, 
and seem to drill efficiently. Nowadays, most insert teeth have this blunt, 
conical shape.
