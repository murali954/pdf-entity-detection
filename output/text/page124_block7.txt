The first type of bearing system used with roller cone bits was a non-
sealed, roller-ball-friction bearing arrangement, utilizing rollers on the heel 
of the journal. The primary load, or stress was exerted on these rollers, and 
drilling fluid was used to lubricate the bearings. Bearing size was 
maximized, since room for a seal was not required. The bearing surfaces 
were machined and ground to very close tolerances to ensure dependable 
service. This type of bearing system is also available with modifications for 
air circulation and for use with a percussion hammer (Figure 3-6a).
