The test for filtrate is carried out by putting 1 or more milliliters of filtrate 
into a titration dish and adding 2 or 3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator 
solution. Drops of 0.02 normal nitric or sulfuric acid solution are then 
added until the pink coloration just disappears. The alkalinity is measured 
as the number of milliliters of acid per milliliter of filtrate. The test for mud 
is similar except that to one milliliter of mud, 25 to 50 milliliters of water 
are added for dilution and 4 or 5 drops of phenolphthalein are added. The 
result is measured the same as for the filtrate.
