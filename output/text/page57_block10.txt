A modification to the Power Law Model, the OXY Model, was proposed 
for use in oil-based muds. The major difference is the viscometer readings 
used to determine the “k” and “n” values. Power Law uses the 300 and 600 
rpm readings, the OXY Model uses the 6 and 100 rpm readings. In 
addition, other models have been proposed that tend to exhibit behavior 
between the Bingham and Power Law models at low shear rates.
