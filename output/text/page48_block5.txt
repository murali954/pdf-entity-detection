Gel strength is measured with the viscometer by stirring the mud at high 
speeds for about 15 seconds and then turning the viscometer off or putting 
it into neutral (low gear if it's a lab model) and waiting the desired period, 
(i.e., 10 seconds or 10 minutes). If the viscometer is a simple field model, 
the “gel strength” knob is turned counter clockwise slowly and steadily. 
The maximum dial deflection before the gel breaks is then recorded in lb/
100 ft2. With a lab model, the procedure is the same except a low speed is 
used. After a wait, the second gel can be taken in a similar manner.
