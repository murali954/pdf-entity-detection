These meridians of longitude converge towards the North Pole and do not 
produce a rectangular grid system. The grid lines on a map form the 
rectangular grid system, the Northerly direction of which is determined by 
one specified meridian of longitude. This “Grid North” direction will only 
be identical to “True North” on a specified meridian.
