Proper dispersion of the colloidal clays in the mud gives a good overlap of 
particles, thus giving good filtration control. A flocculated mud, which has 
aggregates of particles, allows fluid to pass through easily. The addition of 
chemicals to act as dispersants will increase the efficiency of the filter 
cake.
