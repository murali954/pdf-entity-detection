The safest approach to designing and using a pendulum assembly is to 
concentrate on producing a side force at the bit on the low side of the 
hole. This is achieved by running an assembly where the pendulum 
portion will be as stiff and straight as possible. It is also desirable that 
the section immediately above the first string stabilizer be stiff and 
straight and that a second string stabilizer be within 30 feet of the first.
