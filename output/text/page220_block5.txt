This assembly is tripped out and the mill changed. A tungsten carbide or 
diamond speed mill is used to cut the rest of the window. Once the window 
has been cut, approximately 5 feet of formation is cut before pulling out of 
hole. Next, a taper mill is run with a watermelon mill immediately above it. 
This is done to “clean” the top and the bottom of the window. Finally, 
another trip is made to change over to the drilling assembly which is used 
to drill ahead.
