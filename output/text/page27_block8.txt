These “lower than hydrostatic pressure” systems are of four types: 1) dry 
air or gas is injected into the borehole to remove cuttings and can be used 
until appreciable amounts of water are encountered, 2) mist drilling is then 
used, which involves injecting a foaming agent into the air stream, 3) foam 
drilling is used when large amounts of water is encountered, which uses 
chemical detergents and polymers to form the foam, and 4) aerated fluids is 
a mud system injected with air to reduce the hydrostatic pressure.
