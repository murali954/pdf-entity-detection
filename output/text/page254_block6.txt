Most oilfield drilling is done in sedimentary rocks. Due to the nature of 
their deposition, sedimentary rocks have layers or bedding planes, causing 
most sedimentary rocks to show some degree of anisotropy. Drilling into 
dipping (tilted) formations has shown that the drill bit is forced towards a 
preferential direction related to the dip angle and direction of the bedding. 
The trends are most prevalent in low angle, medium to hard drilling, 
especially in formations with pronounced structure.
