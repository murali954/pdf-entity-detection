When harder formations tended to “eat up” the steel teeth, a different 
cutting structure was needed, and in 1949 the first insert bit was used. 
Introduced by Hughes Tool Company and nicknamed the “The Chert Bit”, 
it brought on-bottom drilling hours up from 5 hours to 30 hours or more. 
Many of the design features in the milled tooth bits were incorporated into 
insert bits.
