What should happen (as the pumps are brought up to speed) is that the 
choke should be opened to allow the choke line pressure to drop to zero. 
The casing pressure at the wellhead will still read 300 psi and the drillpipe 
pressure will be maintained at the desired ICP. The choke line friction 
pressure drop of 300 psi has been substituted for the SICP of 300 psi.
