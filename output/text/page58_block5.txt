“Gel strength” is used to measure this time dependent behavior. This gel 
strength measures the attractive forces of a fluid while under static 
conditions. If the gel strength increases steadily with time, the gel strength 
is classed strong or progressive. If it increases slowly with time, it is 
classed as weak or fragile.
