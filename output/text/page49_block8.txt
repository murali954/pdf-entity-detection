H2S as a gas is not particularly corrosive, however if moisture is present it 
will become corrosive and in the presence of CO2 or O2, it becomes 
extremely corrosive. Since H2S is soluble in drilling muds, as the pH 
increases, the total amount of sulfides existing as H2S is reduced. The pH 
should be maintained above 10 if known H2S bearing formations are to be 
drilled. A scavenger should also be added to remove sulfides. The most 
common scavengers are zinc carbonate, zinc chromate, zinc oxide, ironite 
sponge (Fe304) and copper carbonate. The pH will have to be treated as 
scavengers are added.
