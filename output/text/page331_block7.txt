Ram Preventers:
Ram type preventers have two opposing packing elements 
that are closed by moving them together. Rubber packing 
elements again, form the seal. A major difference between 
these and the annular preventer is that they are designed for 
specific applications. Rams are designed for a certain size of 
pipe and will only work on that type of pipe. Also, most ram 
type preventers are designed to seal in only one direction. 
They will only hold a pressure exerted from the lower side. 
Thus they will not function if installed upside down and will 
not pressure test from above. Ram pistons are universal in 
that they may accept any of the following types of ram 
elements.
