The stuck pipe location produced from this equation will be a best guess 
value for a couple of reasons: (1) Since all boreholes are crooked to some 
extent, there can be a considerable amount of friction between the borehole 
and drillpipe, and (2) If the borehole is highly deviated, it will be very 
difficult to place the drillstring in tension without it coming into contact 
with the borehole.
