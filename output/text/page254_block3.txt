When using a pendulum assembly, it is best that the pendulum portion be 
as stiff as possible, so it is preferable to use large diameter collars. 
Reducing collar OD increases the likelihood that the collars will bend 
towards the low side of the hole, which will reduce the pendulum effect 
and the rate of drop. Also, reducing the collar OD reduces the weight of the 
bottom collars which reduces the pendulum force and the rate of drop.
