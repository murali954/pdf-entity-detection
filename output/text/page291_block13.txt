If the driller is unable to free the stuck pipe or the force necessary to free 
the pipe is greater than the force that can be applied by the blocks, then 
other remedial measures must be used. Normally a lubricating fluid is 
“spotted” in the troublesome area and is used to dissolve the filter cake. 
Spotting procedures and calculations have been mentioned in the 
“Advanced Logging Procedures” manual, under “Additional Volume 
Calculations”.
