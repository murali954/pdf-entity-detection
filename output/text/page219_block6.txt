The “Circulating Whipstock” is run, set and drilled like the standard 
whipstock. However, in this case the drilling mud initially flows through a 
passage to the bottom of the whipstock which permits more efficient 
cleaning of the bottom of the hole and ensures a clean seat for the tool. It is 
most efficient for washing out bottom hole fills.
