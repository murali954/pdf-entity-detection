Control of the kick and kill fluids during kill operations is accomplished 
using a choke manifold. This manifold must be able to work under a variety 
of conditions, such as high pressure, with oil, gas, mud and water, and be 
capable of withstanding the effects of abrasive solids (sand and shale) in 
the kick fluids. The manifold should be capable of controlling the well 
using one of several chokes and be able to divert flow to one of several
