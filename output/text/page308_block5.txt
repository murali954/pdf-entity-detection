When drilling close to balance (between equivalent circulating density and 
pore pressure), flow into the annulus may occur when the pumps are shut 
off. This is caused by the removal of the annular pressure loss, which 
increases the bottomhole pressure while circulating. When the kelly is 
lifted, swab pressures can further reduce bottomhole pressure. An increase 
in hookload may indicate that a lighter fluid has invaded the hole as the less 
dense invading fluid reduces the buoyancy effect on the drillstring, hence 
the higher hookload.
