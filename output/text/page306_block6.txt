The only time a kick can occur without warning is when drilling offshore 
and there is no annular connection between the wellhead and the rig. 
However, there is never a lack of indications that a kick or blowout is 
occurring. In the majority of situations the borehole and mud pits are a 
closed circulating system, the addition of any fluid from the formation will 
result in a change in return flow and a change in the active pit volume.
