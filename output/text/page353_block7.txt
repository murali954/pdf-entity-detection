In this case, the operator does not have good offset well data and no 
realistic value of cost per foot is available. The operatorâ€™s engineers agree 
that the interval is PDC drillable, and it will be economical to run PDC bits 
provided no more than two bits are required to drill the section and 
provided an average ROP of 16 ft/hr can be achieved. The proposed well is 
vertical and they are not persuaded that running a downhole motor will be 
cost effective.
