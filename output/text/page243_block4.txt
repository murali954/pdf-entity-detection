Figure 5-39: The tandem stabilizers make this assembly very rigid. 
In the past it was more common to use tandem stabilizers to 
control the bit walk of roller cone bits. Presently, its use is 
limited to areas where extreme bit walk is common. Rotation of 
an assembly such as this will generate high rotary torque. 
Generally, as the number of stabilizers in the BHA 
increases, so does the possibility of hole sticking.
