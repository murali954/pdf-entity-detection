Insufficient Mud Density: Fewer kicks result from too low a mud density 
than the previous two causes. If a kick occurs while drilling, due to 
insufficient mud density, it is possible that an oversight has occurred or that 
poor engineering practices were employed. In any event, pressure trends 
and plots will have to be re-evaluated. Penetration into a geopressured 
formation without prior indication may have occurred, or a fault or 
unconformity may have been crossed. Also changes in lithology or drilling 
practices may have masked a transition zone.
