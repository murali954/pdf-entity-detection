The Navi-Drill Mach 1/AD motor is designed specifically for use in holes 
drilled with air and mist. With an AKO, the steerable motor drilling system 
combines directional and straight hole drilling capabilities to provide 
precise directional control. Generally, in one run it can establish the desired 
direction and inclination for the surface interval of a directional well.
