To complete the journal-cone assembly, a positive seal is required to keep 
drilling fluid out, while allowing the graphite lubricant in, which keeps the 
bearings from overheating. The positive seal requires a relief valve to allow 
escape of excess pressure, which can overload the seal and cause seal 
failure.
