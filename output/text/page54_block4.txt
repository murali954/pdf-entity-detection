The concept that a fluid cannot maintain a rigid shape is a basic, but 
important characteristic, which means that fluids cannot sustain a shear-
stress (a tangential force applied to the surface). Any tangential force will 
cause the fluid to deform and continuous deformation is known as “flow”. 
Fluid flow is always considered to take place within a conductor. A 
conductor may be the annulus created by casing for drilling fluid or a 
volcano’s slope and the atmosphere, in the case of a lava flow.
