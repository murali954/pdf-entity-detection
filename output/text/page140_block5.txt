Some formations are more drillable with diamond bits than others, but 
these formations and their drillability change from area to area. Diamond 
bits normally perform better in hard formations, because it is easier to keep 
the bit clean, the cuttings are smaller, and individual diamonds cut with a 
plowing action rather than by chipping and tearing.
