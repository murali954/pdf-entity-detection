This initial decrease is not seen in the two circulation method, since the 
mud density has not changed, and as can be seen, the casing pressure 
increases as the gas expansion displaces mud from the hole. The second 
pressure difference is noted when the gas approaches the surface. The two 
circulation method, again, has the higher pressures which is the result of 
circulating the original mud density during the first circulation.
