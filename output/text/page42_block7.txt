Imposed pressures can also originate from a formation. If formation 
pressure exceeds hydrostatic pressure, and the well is shut-in, the pressure 
differential between the hydrostatic of the drilling fluid and the formation 
pressure, will be imposed throughout the system. This pressure can be read 
at the surface. At the surface, two different readings will be noted. These 
will be the drillpipe (pump) pressure and the casing (choke) pressure.
