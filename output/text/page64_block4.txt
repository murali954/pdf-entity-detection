One of the primary functions of a drilling fluid is to bring the drilled 
cuttings to the surface. Inadequate hole cleaning can lead to a number of 
problems, including hole fill, packing off, stuck pipe, and excessive 
hydrostatic pressure. The ability of a drilling fluid to lift cuttings is affected 
by many factors, and there is no universally accepted theory which can 
account for all observed phenomena. Some of the parameters which affect 
cuttings transport are the fluids density and viscosity, annular size and 
eccentricity, annular velocity and flow regime, pipe rotation, cuttings 
density, and the size and shape of the cuttings.
