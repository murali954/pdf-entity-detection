The desired metallurgical properties and physical strengths are developed 
through heat treating. As mentioned above, the strength is improved by 
increasing the carbon content at the surface by carbonizing, commonly 
known as “case hardening”. This is essential for the teeth on milled tooth 
bits, and necessary for strength and wear resistance on the bearing surfaces. 
Toughness (resistance to impact and crack propagation) is attained by 
leaving the inner part or the “core steel” unchanged.
