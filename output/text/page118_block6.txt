The first successful rolling cutter rock bit was introduced into the oil field 
by Howard Hughes Sr. in 1909. Over the next fifteen years, the rolling 
cutter bit was used primarily in hard formation areas. This rolling cutter bit 
was a two-cone bit with cones that did not mesh, consequently, the bit had 
a tendency to “balled-up” in soft shales. The bit was redesigned with 
meshing teeth (self-cleaning) in the 1920s and in the early 1930’s, the tri-
cone bit was introduced with cutters designed for hard and soft formations.
