The coefficient of friction is the ratio of the force necessary to initiate 
sliding of the plate to the normal force on the plate. The core face of the 
stickometer is 3.14 inches, the radius of the plate is 1 inch, and the 
differential pressure used is 500 psi. Because of the geometry of the core 
face the torque is multiplied by 1.5. The formula then becomes:
