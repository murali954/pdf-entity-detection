By moving the placement higher up in the BHA will make it 
harder to get away from vertical in a kick-off, however, once an 
initial inclination is achieved, the rate of build is often greater 
than the TGDS. For flat turns or for dropping angle, increasing 
the distance from the motor to the first string stabilizer will 
reduce the dogleg.
