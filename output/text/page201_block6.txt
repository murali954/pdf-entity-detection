A turbine consists of a multistage vane-type rotor and stator section, a 
bearing section, a drive shaft and a bit rotating sub. A “stage” consists of a 
rotor and stator of identical profile. The stators are stationary, locked to the 
turbine body, and deflect the flow of drilling mud onto the rotors which are 
locked to the drive shaft. As the rotors are forced to turn, the drive shaft is 
also forced to turn, causing the bit sub and the bit to rotate
