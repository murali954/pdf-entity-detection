The decision concerning which bit to use often based on some performance 
criteria, such as total rotating hours, total footage, or maximum penetration 
rate. Other times, the least expensive bit is chosen. This approach may be 
satisfactory in areas where practices and costs are constants but it may not 
be satisfactory where drilling costs are changing, and drilling practices and 
bit selection vary.
