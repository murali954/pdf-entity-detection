If it is known how many feet are to be drilled in the zone, a vertical reading 
from the intersection of this value with the breakeven line will indicate the 
required hours. If the best guess which can be made is penetration rate, a 
line may be constructed from the “zero” point at this rate and its 
intersection with the breakeven line provides readings of both footage and 
hours. In this example, it is assumed that a 600 foot section will be drilled, 
and the chart indicates the run will be economical if it takes 92 hours or 
less.
