In medium to hard rocks, which have an appreciable degree of anisotropy, 
directional tendencies can be significantly affected by formation attitudes 
and in particular by the effective dip angle of the bedding planes. If the 
effective dip angle is less than 45° - 60º, the bit tends to drill up-dip. When 
the effective dip angle is greater than 60°, the bit tends to drill down dip. 
When the effective dip angle is approximately 0°, there is no tendency to 
deviate.
