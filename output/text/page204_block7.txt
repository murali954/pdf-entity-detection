U-joint assemblies (Figure 5-22a) have been utilized by the industry and 
are still used in most positive displacement motors. The assembly consists 
of two universal joints, each grease filled, and sealed with oil-resistant 
reinforced rubber sleeves to protect them from drill fluid contamination. A 
drawback of the U-joint assembly is the lack of sufficient strength for 
higher torque applications, such as those encountered with recent 
generations of high torque PDMâ€™s, particularly when used with PDC bits.
