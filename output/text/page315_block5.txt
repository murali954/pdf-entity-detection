For a well to be killed successfully, the pressure in the formation must be 
kept under control during the entire kill operation. The only exception is in 
cases when the maximum allowable annular pressure will be exceeded. 
The simplest method of doing this is to control the drillpipe pressure by 
running the kill pump at a constant rate and controlling the pressure by 
regulating the choke on the choke line.
