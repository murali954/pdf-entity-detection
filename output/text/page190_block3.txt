Coordinates in the UTM system are measured in meters. North coordinates 
being measured from the equator. For the Northern hemisphere, the 
equator is taken as 0.00m North whereas for the Southern hemisphere the 
equator is 10,000,000m North (to avoid negative numbers). East 
coordinates for each sector are measured from a line 500,000m west of the 
central meridian for that sector. In other words, the central meridian for 
each zone is arbitrarily given the coordinate 500,000m East. Again, this 
avoids negative numbers.
