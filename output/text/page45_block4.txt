Shear rate is the rate of change as the fluid layers move past one another 
per unit distance, and is measured in reciprocal seconds (i.e. (ft/sec)/ft) and 
is usually written as seconds-1. To convert the dial reading to shear stress, 
the dial reading is multiplied by 1.067 to give a reading in lb/100ft2.
