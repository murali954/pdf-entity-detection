Deep cones having a 70° apex angle are normally used to give 
built-in stability and greater diamond concentration at the cone 
apex. In certain formations, a deep cone could fracture the 
formation horizontally, leaving a plug in the bit cone. Thereafter, 
the formation plug would be ground and splintered away beneath 
the bit face, inducing diamond breakage and premature failure. 
In fracturing type formations, a shallower cone angle of about 
90° or 100° may be used.
