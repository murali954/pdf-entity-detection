The unwanted deviation in vertical wells has borne out the predictions of 
the graph shown in Figure 5-49. Drilling through alternately hard and soft 
formations with low dip angles, using a well stabilized bit and weights high 
enough to cause collar flexure, usually results in a course perpendicular to 
the bedding planes.
