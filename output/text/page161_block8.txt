In smaller hole sizes on high-angle wells (over 45°), drill pipe may be 
run in compression to contribute to the weight on bit, provided the 
maximum compressive load is less than the critical buckling force. 
This critical buckling force is the minimum compressive force which 
will cause sinusoidal buckling of the drill pipe.
