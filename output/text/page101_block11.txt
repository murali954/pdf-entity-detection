Pozzolans are natural or artificial siliceous materials added to portland 
cement to reduce slurry density and viscosity. The material may be either a 
volcanic ash or a clay high in silica. The silica in the pozzolans combines 
with the free lime in dry cement, which means a soluble constituent is 
removed from the cement and the new cement is made more resistive.
