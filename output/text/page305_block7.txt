Failure To Keep The Hole Full: The majority of kicks occur when the bit 
is off bottom, while tripping. When the pumps are shut down prior to 
tripping, there is a pressure reduction in the borehole equal to the annular 
pressure losses. If the equivalent circulating density and the pore pressure 
are nearly equal, flow may occur when circulation stops. As pipe is 
removed, the mud-level in the borehole falls, causing a reduction in 
hydrostatic pressure. Pipe displacement volume must be converted into 
pump strokes so the correct number of strokes to fill the bore-hole is 
known.
