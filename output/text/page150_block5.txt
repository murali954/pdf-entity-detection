Drillstrings weigh less in weighted fluids than in air due to a fluid property 
known as buoyancy. Therefore, what is seen as the hookload is actually the 
buoyed weight of the drillstring. Archimedesâ€™s principle states that the 
buoy force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Another way of 
saying this is that a buoy force is equal to the pressure at the bottom of the 
string multiplied by the cross sectional area of the tubular. This is due to 
the fact that the force of buoyancy is not a body force such as gravity, but a 
surface force.
