PDC blanks are self-sharpening in the sense that small, sharp crystals are 
repeatedly exposed as each blank wears, and because they are 
polycrystalline these blanks have no inherently weak cleavage planes, 
which can result in massive fractures as in the large, single crystal 
diamonds in the diamond bits.
