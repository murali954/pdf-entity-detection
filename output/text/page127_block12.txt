The chief advantage of this concept is that there is virtually no change in 
the configuration of the cutting structure due to wear. In addition, any bit 
often finds good application in a variety of formations. Thus, the limiting 
factor on performance is usually the life of the bearing assembly (providing 
formation changes do not cut short the bit run).
