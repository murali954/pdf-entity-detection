For those working at wellsites, a basic knowledge of “fluid” properties is 
required, especially those properties that distinguish fluids from solids. 
Fluids can be either a gas or a liquid, where gases are highly compressible 
and its volume being dependent upon pressure and temperature. Liquids, 
on the other hand, are only slightly compressible, and their volume being 
only slightly dependent upon temperature.
