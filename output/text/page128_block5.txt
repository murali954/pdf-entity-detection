At present, the manner in which insert bits now function closely parallels 
the mechanics of the three major categories of milled tooth bits, soft 
(gouging/spading), medium (chipping plus limited penetration), and hard 
(crushing/fracturing). For this reason, the composition as well as the 
configuration of the insert material is being subjected to constant 
evaluation and improvement. To date, the ultimate in both areas has not 
been determined.
