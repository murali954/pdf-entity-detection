Note that the choke line pressure drop is greater than the SICP. In this 
instance, it is impossible to open the choke to substitute all of the choke 
pressure loss for the casing pressure. The surface choke pressure will read 
zero but 100 psi would still be imposed below the BOP stack. This is in 
effect an “overkill” of 100 psi. This will result in the drillpipe pressure 
increasing by 100 psi also. This cannot be adjusted to the desired pressure 
as the choke is still already open. Figures 8-9c through 8-9e illustrate this 
overkill. To reduce the “overkill”, the choke line pressure drop must be
