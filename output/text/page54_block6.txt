Laminar Flow is usually found in the annulus during drilling operations. 
This type of flow is generally desired in the annulus since it does not lead 
to hole erosion and does not produce excessive pressure drops. These 
pressure drop calculations can be mathematically derived according to the 
type of flow behavior.
