Decisions made under kick situations depend upon the knowledge, attitude 
and judgement of the supervisor. These can be confused by crew change 
problems and the divided responsibilities between the rig superintendent/
toolpusher and the oil company representative/drilling engineer. One of the 
most important elements of a well control program is the establishment of 
policies and procedures outlined in detail. This procedure must be made 
known to Baker Hughes INTEQ personnel. It is the responsibility of the 
senior person or Field Supervisor to obtain this information as soon as 
possible.
