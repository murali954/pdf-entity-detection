The pistons on the mud pumps stroke forward and backward to push the 
drilling fluid through the system. The stroke rate is measured in strokes per 
minute (spm). A set number of strokes per minute are necessary to circulate 
at the predetermined flow rate and pressure. With the pump pressure 
constant variations in the stroke rate can indicate problems.
