The rate of build increases as the inclination increases because there is a 
larger component of the collars’ own weight causing them to bend. The 
mechanics involved predicts that the rate of build should increase in direct 
proportion to the sine of the inclination. In reality, the situation and the 
actual response is more complicated. For example, a strong build assembly 
which built at a rate of 1.5°/100’ when the inclination was only 15° might 
build at 4°/100’ when the inclination was 60°.
