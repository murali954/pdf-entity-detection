An increase in pit volume may be noticed only after the 
connection. Usually, when the pumps are shut off, some of the 
mud from the surface equipment will flow back into the active 
pit. When the levels have stabilized, after the pumps are 
restarted, an increase in level prior to the connection indicates 
that a flow has occurred. The volume of mud from the surface 
equipment should be established at the start of each new job and 
re-established periodically as the well progresses (e.g. a 2 bbl 
increase on a connection may be normal, while a 3 bbl increase 
may be significant).
