Unwanted deviation tendencies caused by the formation can best be 
reduced by packed assemblies. The use of a full gauge near-bit stabilizer 
definitely reduces bit walk. In cases where strong formation effects have 
been observed on previous wells in the same area, the BHA design should 
be suitably modified to compensate for the anticipated effect.
