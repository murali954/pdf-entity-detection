These drill blanks consist of a layer of synthetic polycrystalline diamond 
bonded to a layer of cemented tugsten carbide using a high-temperature, 
high-pressure bonding technique. The resulting blank has the hardness and 
wear resistance of diamond which is complemented by the strength and 
impact resistance of tungsten carbide.
