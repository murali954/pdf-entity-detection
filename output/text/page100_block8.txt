Chemical washes are fluids containing surfactants and mud thinners, 
designed to thin and disperse the drilling fluid so that it can be removed 
from the casing and borehole. Washes are available for water-based and 
oil-based drilling fluids. They are designed to be used in turbulent flow 
conditions.
