There are no specific rates at which bullheading should be performed. At 
slow rates (the pressures are within the boundaries of casing burst pressure) 
the pump rate can be increased until the higher pressure will become 
detrimental to the operation. The higher pump rates are desirable to pump 
the influx away as soon as possible, and to overcome any gas migration.
