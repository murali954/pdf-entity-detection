Several factors affect hole drag, including hole inclination, dogleg severity, 
hole condition, mud properties, hole size, and drillstring component types, 
sizes and placement. However, as mentioned earlier, in drilling situations 
where the drillstring is not rotated (as when a steerable system is used in 
the oriented mode) axial drag can become very significant and should be 
evaluated using a Torque and Drag computer program. Torque and Drag 
programs can be found in EC*Track and DrillByte.
