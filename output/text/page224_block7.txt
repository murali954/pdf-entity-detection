At the start of a kick-off, jetting is repeated every single until about 3º of 
angle has been built. After that, it is normal to jet every “double”. After 
drilling each section, the jet nozzle has to be re-orientated to the desired 
tool face setting before jetting again. The operation is repeated until 
sufficient angle has been built and the well is heading in the desired 
direction.
