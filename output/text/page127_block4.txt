The degree of hardness that can be produced in steel is determined by its 
carbon content, the higher the percentage of carbon (up to 0.7%), the 
harder the steel. By heat treating properly, it can be made up to about 65 
Rc. Alloying elements improve the hardening potential in thick sections 
and cause the steel to have a more uniform response to heat treating. The 
steel must also be ductile (resistance to crack propagation). This ductility 
or “toughness” of metals is inversely related to hardness (the harder a 
metal, the less ductile. The softer the steel, the more ductile). Alloying 
elements improve the ductility of steels and toughness, and resistance to 
failure from impact loads.
