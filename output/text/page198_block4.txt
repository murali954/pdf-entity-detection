The selection of both the kick-off point and the build-up rate depends on 
many factors. Several being hole pattern, casing program, mud program, 
required horizontal displacement and maximum tolerable inclination. 
Choice of kick-off points can be limited by requirements to keep the well 
path at a safe distance from existing wells. The shallower the KOP and the 
higher the build-up rate used, the lower the maximum inclination.
