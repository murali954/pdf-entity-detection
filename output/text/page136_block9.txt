Cutting casing windows: Window cutting through casing using 
diamond bits is now an effective, field-proven method for re-entering 
older wells to increase production, to apply directional drilling 
techniques, or to sidetrack. Using permanent casing whipstocks and 
specially designed diamond bits, wider and longer windows are cut 
when sidetracking.
