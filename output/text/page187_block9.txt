With the exception of Inertial Navigation Systems, all survey systems 
measure inclination and azimuth at a particular measured depth (depths 
measured “along hole”). These measurements are tied to fixed reference 
systems so that the course of the borehole can be calculated and recorded. 
These reference systems include:
