When all the calculations have been performed, the mud density is raised 
immediately to the calculated kill mud density. When the kill mud volume 
is ready, the pumps are started and the choke slowly opened, while keeping 
the annular pressure constant until the pump has reached kill rate. The 
choke is then regulated in such a way as to decrease the drillpipe pressure 
until the kill mud reaches the bit, at which point the final circulating 
pressure is reached.
