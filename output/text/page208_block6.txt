The motor has a multi-lobe (5/6) rotor/stator configuration, which 
generates higher torque than the 1/2 lobe motors, permitting more weight-
on-bit and increasing the drill rate. Because the motor develops its power at 
low speeds, it can improve bit performance without accelerating wear on 
the bearings or cones.
