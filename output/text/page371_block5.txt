Determine deadlines for each stage of the writing task: 
Normally, rough drafts of the FWR are required after each casing 
point and at the end of the well. These deadlines also include 
when the final version of the report is due, when the illustrations 
or plots/prints are due, and when all are to be delivered to the 
client.
