Adequate cleaning is even more important with sealed bearing bits. If 
drilled cuttings are allowed to build up around the shirttail, seal damage 
and premature bearing failure may result. Gauge protection is also 
important to seal and bearing life, because seal damage can occur from 
shirttail wear caused by inadequate gauge protection.
