The system used for closing the BOP's is a high pressure hydraulic fluid 
accumulator. Hydraulic fluid is stored under pressure, the pressure being 
provided by stored nitrogen. When hydraulic oil is forced into the 
accumulator by a small volume, high pressure pump, the nitrogen is 
compressed, storing potential energy. When the BOP's are activated the 
pressured oil is released, either opening or closing the BOP's. Hydraulic 
pumps replenish the accumulator with the same amount of fluid that was 
used to operate the BOP. The accumulator must also be equipped to allow 
varying pressures. When stripping pipe through an annular preventer, a 
constant pressure must be maintained as the tool joints pass through the 
packing element. Accumulators commonly have minimum working 
pressures of 1200 psi and maximum working pressures of between 1500 
and 3000 psi.
