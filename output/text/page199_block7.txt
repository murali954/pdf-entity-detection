In the old days (pre 1985) it was normal practice to allow a “lead angle” 
when kicking off. Since roller cone bits used with rotary assemblies tend to 
“walk to the right”, the wells were generally kicked off in a direction 
several degrees to the left of the target direction. In extreme cases the lead 
angles could be as large as 20°.
