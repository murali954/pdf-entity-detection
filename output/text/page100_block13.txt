An accelerator is a chemical additive used to speed up the normal rate of 
reaction between cement and water which shortens the thickening time of 
the cement, increase the early strength of cement, and saves time on the 
drilling rig. Cement slurries used opposite shallow, low-temperature 
formations require accelerators to shorten the time for "waiting-on-
cement". Most operators wait on cement to reach a minimum compressive 
strength of 500 psi before resuming drilling operations. When using 
accelerators, this strength can be developed in 4 hours. It is a good practice 
to use accelerators with basic cements because at temperatures below 
100oF, neat cement may require 1 or 2 days to develop a 500 psi 
compressive strength.
