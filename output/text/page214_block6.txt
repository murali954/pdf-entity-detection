For the Mach 1/AD motor, a cartridge data transmission (CDT) system has 
been developed that allows orientation of the motor in a particular 
direction, while still allowing drilling with drillstring rotation. This CDT 
system uses a special heavy duty steering tool which provides continuous 
surface readout of the drift angle and azimuth, as well as toolface 
orientation while drilling ahead.
