Fly ash, a synthetic pozzolan, is another major constituent of cements. A 
fly ash/cement mixture is designated as the ratio of fly ash to cement 
(expressed as 50:50 or 60:40, etc.) with the total always equaling 100. The 
first number is the percentage of fly ash (74 lbs/sack), the second number is 
cement (94 lbs/sack). A sack of fly ash and a sack of cement have the same 
absolute volume.
