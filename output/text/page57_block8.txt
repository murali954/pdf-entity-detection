It describes the thickness or pumpability of the fluid, and is somewhat 
analogous to the apparent viscosity. The flow behavior index (n) indicates 
the degree of non-Newtonian characteristics of the fluid. As the fluid 
becomes more viscous, the consistency factors (k) increases; as a fluid 
becomes more shear thinning “n” decreases. When “n” is 1 the fluid is 
Newtonian. If “n” is greater than 1, the fluid is classed as Dilatant (the 
apparent viscosity increases as the shear rate increases). If “n” is between 
zero and 1 the fluid is classified as Pseudoplastic, exhibiting 
shear-thinning; (i.e., the apparent viscosity decreases as the shear rate 
increases). For drilling fluids, this is a desirable property and most drilling 
fluids are pseudoplastics.
