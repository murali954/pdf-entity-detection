An understanding of lubricants and lubricating systems is necessary for 
successful drilling operations. The lubricating systems are essentially the 
same, and are composed of an external equalizer located under the bit or on 
back of the shanks, a grease reservoir with some sort of expandable 
diaphragm to distribute the grease, and some sort of distribution system to 
the bearings. In addition, there is a pressure relief valve to release any 
trapped pressure, which might otherwise rupture the seals.
