If you use this checklist regularly when preparing your Final Well Report, 
you will find that you will produce better reports in less time. Most 
technical writers spend approximately 80% of their time preparing to write 
(i.e. collecting data. organizing the outline, etc.) and only 20% of their time 
doing the actual writing. If you can reduce the preparation time, you will 
have more time to devote to the writing.
