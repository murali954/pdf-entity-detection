The majority of the preceding discussion concerned rotary assemblies. 
However, it would also apply to steerable motor systems used in the 
rotary mode, with only minimal oriented drilling anticipated, the 
required BHA weight could be calculated the same way. If a 
significant amount of oriented drilling was likely, then the drag in the 
hole should be evaluated using Torque and Drag computer programs. 
In this type of situation, a proper engineering analysis of BHA weight 
requirements is advised.
