Since kick control procedures are greatly simplified when the bit is near the 
bottom of the hole, as such kicks during tripping operations have the 
greatest potential danger. With the pipe standing on the rig floor, it is 
impossible to get heavy mud to the bottom of the hole. During trips, the 
same annular pressure drop occurs as when the pumps are shut off.
