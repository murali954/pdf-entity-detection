It is recommended that circulation be started prior to reaching bottom and 
that extreme care be used to find bottom. The bit should be rotated slowly 
to bottom, or if possible establish bottom with zero rotation. Then circulate 
with full volume and rotate slowly at a point about one foot or less off 
bottom for a period of at least five minutes to clean the bottom of the hole.
