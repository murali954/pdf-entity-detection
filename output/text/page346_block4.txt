The value of accurate drilling data cannot be over-emphasized. Reliable, 
factual data is the foundation of post-well project evaluation and review. 
All information collected becomes extremely useful, from the moment it is 
analyzed until the time it can be relied upon as a planning tool. Wellsite 
information is used by all levels within the industry, from the morning tour 
driller through the drilling engineering sections of the operator and service 
companies.
