If drill collars and heavy weight are both being used, calculating the 
location of the neutral point becomes a little harder. First, you should use 
the previous formula to see if the neutral point is in the collars. If Lnp is less 
than the length of the collars, then the neutral point is in the collars. If Lnp 
is more than the length of the collars, the following formula should be used 
to determine how far up in the heavy weight the neutral point is located.
