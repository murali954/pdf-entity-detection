The whipstock assembly is lowered to the bottom of the hole and 
orientated. Weight is applied to set the whipstock and shear the pin. The bit 
is then drilled down and forced to deflect to one side. A 12 to 16 foot “rat 
hole” is drilled below the toe of the whipstock and the assembly is then 
pulled out of hole, taking the whipstock with it. A hole opener is run to 
open the rat hole out to full gauge. The hole opener assembly is then 
tripped out and a rapid angle build assembly run in hole to “follow up”the 
initial deflection. This whole procedure may have to be repeated several 
times in the kick-off.
