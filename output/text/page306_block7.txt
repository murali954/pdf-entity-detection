One rare occurrence when surface recognition may be delayed is during 
lost circulation. The annulus is not full and cannot be filled. When the rate 
of loss is greater than the rate at which fluid can be pumped into the hole, it 
is not possible to monitor the fluid levels. A major influx may occur and it 
will not be detected at the surface. If such an event occurs, the well should 
be shut in, and the shut-in pressures monitored. Pipe movement can be 
made by stripping through the BOP's and the hole can be filled using the 
choke and kill lines.
