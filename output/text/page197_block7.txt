Proponents of the catenary method argue that it results in a smoother 
drilled wellbore, that drag and torque are reduced and that there is less 
chance of key seating and differential sticking. However, in practice it is 
hard to pick BHAs which will continuously give the required gradual rate 
of build. It is in reality no easier to follow a catenary curve well plan than a 
traditional well plan. Also, the catenary curve method produces a higher 
maximum inclination than would result from the build and hold or S type 
patterns.
