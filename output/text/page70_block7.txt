Since PDC bits are formation specific (best used in plastic formations), the 
formation characteristics will determine the hydraulic energy required. The 
drilling fluid will dictate the HSI, for water-based drilling fluids it will be 
between 2.5 and 4.5, while for oil-based drilling fluids it will be between 
1.5 and 3.0.
