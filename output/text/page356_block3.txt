Finally, a line is drawn through points “A” and “B” and projected through 
the grid to represent performance which will give the breakeven drilling 
cost. Any combination of feet and hours on the line equals the “target” 
cost, a combination under the line is more expensive and above the line is 
cheaper. In this example, the breakeven line represents $53.45/ft. Some 
combinations, (for instance of 400 feet in 80 hours), would exceed this 
cost; if a bit drilled 500 feet in 60 hours, it would be less expensive.
