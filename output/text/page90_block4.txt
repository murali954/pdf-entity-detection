Casing has several important functions during the drilling and completing 
of a well. It is used to prevent the borehole from caving in during the 
drilling of the well, to provide a means of controlling fluids encountered 
while drilling, to prevent contamination of fluids to be produced, and to 
protect or isolate certain formations during the course of a well. Casing is 
also one of the most expensive parts of a well, around 20% of the cost of a 
completed well.
