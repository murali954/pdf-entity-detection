The following chart is a rule of thumb which can be used when orienting 
deflection tools or steerable motors. The chart is applicable to steerable 
systems in most situations. It may not be applicable to slick motor and bent 
sub assemblies, used at higher inclinations (over 30o) in soft or medium 
soft formations.It will give the qualitative changes in inclination and 
azimuth which should result from drilling with the given tool face settings.
