On multi-well platforms, only a few wells are given deep kick-off points, 
because of the small slot separation and the difficulty of keeping wells 
vertical in firmer formation. Most wells are given shallow kick-off points 
to reduce congestion below the platform and to minimize the risk of 
collisions.
