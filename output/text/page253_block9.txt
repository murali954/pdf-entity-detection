The thing to notice is that most types of steel and monel which are actually 
used in drill collars have about the same modulus of elasticity and density. 
So in practice the stiffness of a drill collar depends almost entirely on its 
outside diameter and is proportional to the fourth power of the OD. 
However, aluminum drill collars would be more limber than steel drill 
collars of the same dimensions whereas tungsten collars would be much 
stiffer.
