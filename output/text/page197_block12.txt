Even this is not always a simple task. From a directional driller's 
viewpoint, slots on the North East side of the platform or pad should be 
used for wells whose targets are in a North Easterly direction. 
Unfortunately there are other considerations (e.g. water injection wells 
may have to be grouped together for manifolding requirements). Also, as 
more wells are drilled and the reservoir model is upgraded, targets can be 
changed or modified.
