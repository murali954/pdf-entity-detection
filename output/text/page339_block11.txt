This procedure is known as a “running kill”. Even though the pumped mud 
will be cut, the annular density will increase as more mud is pumped. As 
the annular density increases, so will the back pressure on the formation, 
resulting in a decreased kick flow rate. A kill can be accomplished with a 
limited volume of mud if the mud is MUCH heavier, and pumping is fast 
and continuous. A running kill of an underground blowout cannot be 
accomplished if the mud weight is only 1 to 2 ppg heavier than the 
estimated bottomhole pressure.
