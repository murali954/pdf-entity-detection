In the case of an underground blowout, lost circulation, or situations 
requiring the low choke pressure control, it may become necessary to 
attempt well control using a weighted settling plug. These are 
deflocculated slurries of weight material in water or oil, weighing between 
18 and 26 ppg, which bridge the hole as a result of high water loss and the 
rapid settling of the weight material once circulation is stopped. Hematite 
is recommended if slurry densities over 22 ppg are required and/or if the 
influx contains H2S, because hematite can act as a secondary scavenger 
(removing the gas by absorption).
