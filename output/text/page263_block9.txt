Allows for extended rotation of the motor with a low eccentricity 
as compared to conventional bent sub or bent housing assemblies 
with comparable dogleg capability. Rotation of the drill string 
negates the effect of the bit tilt and the assembly theoretically 
drills a straight, slightly oversize, hole.
