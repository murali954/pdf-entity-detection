The by-pass valve allows fluid to fill the drill string while tripping in the 
hole and to drain while tripping out. When mud is pumped, the valve closes 
causing fluid to move through the tool. Most valves are of a spring piston 
type which closes under pressure to seal off ports to the annulus. When 
there is no downward pressure, the spring forces the piston up so fluid can 
channel through the ports to the annulus. (Figure 5-20).
