Assume that the well in Exercise #1-4  on page 1-21 is shut in (annular 
preventer & choke are closed) and a small amount of mud is pumped into 
the well using the cementing unit. The pressure will begin to increase 
immediately. This pressure is an imposed pressure, and is felt uniformly 
throughout the well bore.
