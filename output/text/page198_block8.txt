During the eighties, a number of extended reach projects were successfully 
completed. If wells are drilled at inclinations (up to 80°), the area which 
can be covered from a single platform is approximately 8 times that 
covered when maximum inclination of the wells is limited to 60°. 
However, high inclination angles can result in excessive torque and drag on 
the drill string and present hole cleaning, logging, casing, cementing and 
production problems. These can generally be avoided with current 
technology.
