Neat cement slurries set quickly at a BHT greater than 110oF. A retarder is 
an additive used to increase the thickening time of cements. Besides 
extending the pumping time of cements, most retarders affect the viscosity 
to some degree. The governing factors for the use of retarders are 
temperature and depth.
