Production casing is usually the last full string of pipe set in a well. These 
strings are run to isolate producing formations and provide for selective 
production in multi-zone production areas. The size of production casing 
will depend on the expected production rate, the higher the barrel per day 
production rate, the larger the inside diameter of the pipe. Common sizes 
are between 3 and 7 inch (outside diameter).
