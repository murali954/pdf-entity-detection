Though few stuck pipe problems occur while drilling, it is wise to keep in 
mind that they can happen. The most commonly monitored drilling 
parameters which will indicate problems are torque, pump pressure and 
drill rate. Changes in these parameters, when matched with known data 
(i.e. cuttings lithology, ECD) can pin-point mechanisms which can result in 
stuck pipe and other borehole problems.
