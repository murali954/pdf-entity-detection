Calculating the pressure drop in the annulus is complicated by the motion 
of the inner wall of the drillstring. This motion is in the opposite direction 
to the displaced fluid, so the pressure drop will be greater than that for the 
same flowrate in a stationary annulus (see Figure 1-4). Equations 
describing the system can be formulated, but solutions are usually too 
complicated for wellsite use.
