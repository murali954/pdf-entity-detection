Figure 5-42 is possible for certain lengths of pendulum when there is no 
near-bit stabilizer and only one string stabilizer. The collars above the 
upper stabilizer will sag towards the low side of the hole causing a fulcrum 
effect about the string stabilizer and tilting the upper portion of the 
pendulum towards the high side of the hole.Experienced has shown 
instances of pendulum assemblies dropping faster with high WOB and low 
rotary speed.
