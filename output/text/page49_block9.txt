pH is commonly measured with pHydrion paper. This paper is impregnated 
with dyes that render a color which is pH dependent. The paper is placed 
on the surface of the mud which wets the paper. When the color has 
stabilized, it is compared with a color chart. An electronic pH meter may 
also be used.
