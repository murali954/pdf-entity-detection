The amount of surface casing used will depend on the depth of the 
unconsolidated formations. Surface casing is usually set in the first 
competent formation. Normal size for surface casing is between 20 inch 
and 13-3/8 inch (outside diameter). Since temperature, pressure and 
corrosive fluids tend to increase with depth, different grades of casing will 
be required to handle the different well conditions. Purposes of surface 
casing are to:
