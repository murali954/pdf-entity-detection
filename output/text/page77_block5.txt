For Newtonian fluids, the clinging constant depends only on the annulus 
diameter ratio. This is not the case for non-Newtonian fluids, in which the 
clinging constant is also a function of the drilling fluids properties, and of 
fluid and pipe velocity. Calculation of clinging constants for non-
Newtonian fluids is very tedious. Some representative values for Bingham 
fluids and Power Law fluids are shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-6.
