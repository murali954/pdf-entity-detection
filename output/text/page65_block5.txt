Those who have observed a solids tracer emerging over the shale shaker 
will realize the large spread of “cuttings” that occurs. Therefore, any 
calculated estimation of slip velocity will only be an approximation. The 
reason for this “spread” of solids is the particles ability to be carried by the 
drilling fluid. It is a function of its position in the mud stream and the size 
of the particle.
