This is done by: (1) picking up the kelly so the kelly bushings are 
about 10 ft above the rig floor, (2) stopping the pumps, and (3) 
observing the fluid level in the annulus to see if the well is 
flowing. This may be difficult on floating rigs as the level will 
fluctuate with the heave of the rig. In these instances the 
flowcheck should continue for at least 5 minutes, or be 
conducted by circulating through the trip tank and the trip tank 
volume observed for a gain. If the well is flowing, it should be 
shut-in and any resultant pressures checked.
