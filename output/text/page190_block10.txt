Although the coordinates of points on a wellpath could be expressed as 
UTM coordinates, it is not normal practice. Instead, a reference point on 
the platform or rig is chosen as the local origin and given the coordinates 
0,0. On offshore platforms this point is usually the center of the platform. 
The Northings and Eastings points on the wells drilled from the platform 
are referenced to this single origin. This is important when comparing 
positions of wells, in particular for anti-collision analysis.
