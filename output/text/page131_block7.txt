Formations which should be avoided with PDC bits are soft sticky shales 
and clays, abrasive sands, and those formations which are very hard. In 
sticky formations, PDC bits have a tendency to ball up; in abrasive 
formations or hard formations, cutter wear and breakage occur rapidly. 
PDC bits cannot drill as broad a range of formations as roller cone bits, but 
have shown to be competitive with diamond bits. Thus, care must be taken 
when selecting bits for various applications. When properly applied, most 
PDC bits can be run in more than one well.
