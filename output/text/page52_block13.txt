The Marsh Funnel is the field instrument used to measure viscosity. It is 
graduated so that one quart (946 cc) of water will flow through the funnel 
in 26 seconds. To run a test, the bottom orifice is covered and drilling fluid 
is poured over a screen until the funnel is full. When the bottom is 
uncovered, the time required to fill one quart is recorded (in seconds) along 
with the temperature.
