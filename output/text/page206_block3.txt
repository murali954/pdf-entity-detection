The upper and lower radial bearings are lined with tungsten carbide inserts. 
These bearings support the concentrically rotating drive shaft against 
lateral loads. The inherent design of the upper radial bearing limits the 
amount of fluid flow diverted to cool and lubricate the bearing package. 
This diversion of flow is typically 2 - 10%, depending on motor and bit 
pressure drop. The major portion of the drilling fluid is collected by ports 
in the drive shaft and exits through the bit. In some motors, diamond 
bearings are used, which need up to 20% of the flow to be diverted, 
depending upon conditions. Figure 5-23 illustrates typical bearing sections 
found in PDMs.
