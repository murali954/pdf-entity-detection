Regardless of reputation, many drilling engineers were attracted to 
diamond bits because of the ability of being able to stay on the bottom and 
drill for longer periods of time. During the late 1950's several major oil 
companies began research programs on diamond bits, and these studies 
provided a much better understanding of the mechanics of diamond bit 
drilling and the influence of hydraulics on the penetration rate. This, plus 
subsequent developments of more erosion resistant matrix materials, led to 
performance levels in the 1970's which provided cost savings on a regular 
basis.
