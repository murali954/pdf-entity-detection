The kill procedures that involve the least amount of initial waiting time are 
the two circulation method (or driller's method) and the concurrent method. 
In both of these procedures, pumping begins immediately after the shut-in 
pressures are recorded. However, if the time taken to weight-up the mud is 
less than one circulation then the engineers, or one circulation, method may 
be preferred. In certain situations the extra time required for the two 
circulation method may be seriously detrimental to hole stability or may 
cause excessive BOP wear.
