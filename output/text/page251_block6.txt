During the eighties it became common practice to use PDC bits for rotary 
drilling, with low WOB and high rotary speeds. When rotary drilling with 
PDC bits, it has been found that almost no walk occurs (the assemblies 
hold their direction). It has also been found that inclination angle is 
affected by PDC bits, particularly when an angle drop assembly is used.
