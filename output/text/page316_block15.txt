During the first circulation, the mud density in the pits is raised to the kill 
mud density. When the kill mud volume has been achieved, the kill mud is 
circulated. As with the first circulation, the choke is opened and the pump 
speed increased to the kill rate (with the annulus pressure kept constant). 
The annular pressure is kept constant by manipulating the choke until the 
kill mud has reached the bit. As kill mud begins to fill the system, the 
drillpipe pressure will decrease from the initial circulating pressure to the 
final circulating pressure (see Figure 8-2).
