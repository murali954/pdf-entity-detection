Once the drill rate has been optimized and drilling has commenced, there 
are several surface variables which should be monitored to ensure this drill 
rate remains optimized and problems are avoided. Usually, problems with 
the drill rate and well bore will show up on several surface indicators, and 
cross-referencing will help to determine the cause.
