In very soft formations, the formation can be eroded by the drilling fluid 
exiting from the bit nozzles, creating an overgauge hole. This can make it 
hard to build angle, even with a strong build assembly. If this problem is 
anticipated then fairly large nozzles should be fitted into the bit. If it occurs 
while drilling, the pump rate should be reduced and prior to making each 
connection, increase the flow rate to clean the hole with the bit one joint off 
bottom. Hole washing or enlargement in soft formations may also cause 
packed assemblies to give a dropping tendency at high inclinations.
