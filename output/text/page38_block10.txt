This is the pressure created (or needed) to move drilling fluid through pipe. 
In oil field terms, it is the pressure generated by the mud pump in order to 
move the drilling fluid from the mud pump around the system and back to 
the flowline. In this section, the terms Pump Pressure and Hydraulic 
Pressure will be used interchangeably. This type of pressure can be 
calculated at any point in the circulating system.
