Over the past ten years, most of the progress in rolling cutter bits has been 
made in the design of insert bits. Although the merits of tugsten carbide 
bits has long been accepted, it was not until recently that bit manufacturers 
obtained enough experience with the carbide material and design to make it 
possible to consider this type of bit for application in virtually all 
formations - soft, medium and hard.
