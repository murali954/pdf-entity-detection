Another explanation, proposed by McLamore and others, is that of 
preferential chip formation. This considers the mode of chip formation at a 
single tooth. Anisotropic formations have preferential planes of failure. As 
it impacts the formation, the bit tooth sets up a compressive stress in a 
direction perpendicular to the face of the tooth. Shear failure will then 
occur more readily along the bedding planes. When the bit is drilling an 
anisotropic rock, larger chips will be cut rapidly on one side of the bit and 
smaller chips will be cut more slowly on the other. Unequal chip volumes 
will therefore be generated on each side of a bit tooth.
