The possibility of turbulent flow in the annulus must be considered in swab 
and surge calculations. Assuming that the velocity profile in turbulent flow 
is flat, the resultant pressure drop can be estimated by summing the 
pressure drops caused by the velocity at the outer wall and the relative 
velocity (Va - vp) at the inner wall, because Va and vp are of opposite signs. 
With a closed pipe, the turbulent flow clinging constant can be 
approximated by:
