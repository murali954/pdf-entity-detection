It is obvious that the major disadvantage of the standard whipstock is the 
number of “trips” involved. The other important disadvantage is that the 
whipstock produced a sudden, sharp deflection - in other words, a severe 
dogleg - which may give rise to subsequent problems with the hole. The 
advantages are that it is a fairly simple piece of equipment which requires 
relatively little maintenance and has no temperature limitations.
