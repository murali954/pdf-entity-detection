If the collars make contact with low side as shown in the Figure 5-41, then 
the effective length of the pendulum and the side force on low side are both 
reduced. This situation is also undesirable because the bit axis has been 
tilted upwards in relation to the hole axis which will reduce the dropping 
tendency.
