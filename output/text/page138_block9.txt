A diamond is extremely strong in compression, but relatively weak in 
shear, and needs constant cooling when on bottom. The bit is designed and 
the rake of the diamonds set, so that a constant vertical load on the bit 
keeps an even compressive load on the diamonds, and even distribution of 
coolant fluid over the bit face. If there is lateral movement or tilting of the 
bit, an uneven shear load can be put on the diamonds with coolant leakage 
on the opposite side of the bit.
