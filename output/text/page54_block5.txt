Generally, fluid flow can be considered the result of parallel fluid layers 
sliding past one another. The layers adjacent to the conductor adhere to the 
surface and each successive layer slides past its neighbor with increasing 
velocity. This orderly flow pattern is known as laminar flow. At higher 
velocities, these layers lose their order and crash randomly into one another 
with an orderly flow occurring only adjacent to the conductor. This flow 
pattern is known as turbulent flow.
