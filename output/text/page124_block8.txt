The next generation of bearing systems was a sealed roller bearing system, 
having a sealed grease reservoir to lubricate the bearings. The bearing 
system is composed of: 1) a roller-ball-friction or roller-ball-roller bearings 
2) the seal, which retains the lubricant and prevents drilling fluid and 
abrasive cuttings from entering the bearing cavities, 3) the shirttail is 
designed and hardfaced to protect the seal, 4) a lubricant, an 
elasto-hydrodynamic type, is used to ensure minimum friction and wear, 5) 
the reservoir, which stores and supplies the lubricant to the bearings, and 6) 
the vented breather plug, which transfers downhole fluid pressure against
