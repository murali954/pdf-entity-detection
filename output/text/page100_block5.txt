The red bottom plug has a shallow top, is made of rubber, and has a hollow 
core. It is used ahead of the cement slurry to prevent cement/drilling fluid 
contamination and to clean the casing wall of filter cake. After the bottom 
plug comes into contact with the float valve, sufficient pressure (150 to 350 
psi) causes the top diaphragm to rupture, allowing the cement slurry to 
flow through it.
