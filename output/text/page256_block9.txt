The formation attitudes will have a similar effect on directional tendencies. 
For dip angles less than 45Â°, if the direction is up-dip, the bit will tend to 
maintain direction, but build angle. If the borehole direction is left of up-
dip, the bit may tend to walk to the right; whereas if the direction is right of 
up-dip the bit tends to walk to the left. Both phenomena are just special 
cases of the up-dip tendency.
