If a gas kick is taken, annular pressures may become alarmingly high 
during the course of the kill operation. This is due to gas expansion as it 
nears the surface. This is normal. If expansion is not allowed to occur, 
severe pressures will be placed on the annulus and surface equipment. For 
this reason, the most reliable well killing procedures utilize a constant 
drillpipe pressure and a variable annular pressure (through a variable 
choke) during circulation.
