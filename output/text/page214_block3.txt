When an alignment bent sub (ABS) is fitted to the top of the motor and 
used in conjunction with the AKO, the motor configuration can be used for 
building angle, as in a fixed angle build motor. Orientation of the motor 
and drillstring is possible in this configuration, but not rotation. The 
maximum build rate possible from this configuration is approximately 20Â°/
100 ft.
