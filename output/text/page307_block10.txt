A reduction in flowline mud density occurs as the invading fluids 
reach the surface. This reduction is severe with a gas kick, but 
may be large or unnoticeable with a water kick (depending on the 
mud density). Large amounts of gas can be dissolved in the kick 
fluids and as the kick fluid reach the surface, high gas shows will 
occur.
