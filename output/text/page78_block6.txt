The point at which transition occurs from laminar to turbulent flow is 
difficult to determine theoretically, and experimental data is lacking. It is 
therefore recommended that, for swab and surge pressure calculations, 
both laminar and turbulent pressure drops be calculated. The flow regime 
giving the greater pressure drop may then be considered to be correct. This 
procedure is conservative in that it will give a pressure equal to or 
exceeding the true swab or surge pressure.
