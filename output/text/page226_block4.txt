A common method of deflecting wellbores is to use a downhole motor and 
a bent sub. As illustrated in Figure 5-29, the bent sub is placed directly 
above the motor and the bent sub which makes this a deflection assembly. 
Its lower thread (on the pin) is inclined 1° - 3° from the axis of the sub 
body.
