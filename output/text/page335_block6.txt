When using the Low Choke method, the weight material should be added 
to the mud system as rapidly as possible, while applying the maximum 
allowable casing pressure, because the annular pressure drop will aid this 
method. The highest possible circulation rates possible should be used 
(except in the case of subsea BOP stacks where the choke line friction will 
be excessive. In these cases, the returns should be circulated up both the 
choke and kill lines, and circulation carried out at the maximum rate that 
will not cause shoe breakdown due to the imposed choke and kill line 
friction pressures).
