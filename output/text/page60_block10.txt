The pressure required to circulate fluid in turbulent flow varies by 
approximately 1.8 power of the flowrate. Doubling the flowrate would 
increase the pressure drop in the drillstring by approximately 3.5 times. 
Typically, the pressure losses in the drillstring are about 35 percent of the 
total pump pressure.
