Another phenomenon which occurs with natural diamond bits is called 
hydraulic pump-off. The hydrodynamic pressure of the mud at the bit acts 
over the bit face area (between the cutting face of the bit and the formation) 
and tends to lift the bit off the bottom of the hole. For example, the pump-
off force on a 8-1/2 inch radial flow diamond bit (having a pressure drop of 
900 psi) would be approximately 8600 pounds. It will require at least this 
much bit weight to keep the face of the bit in contact with the bottom of the 
hole.
