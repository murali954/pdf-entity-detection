Magnetic or Gyro Toolface is the toolface orientation measured as a 
direction on the horizontal plane. If measured by a “magnetic” type survey 
tool, it is called magnetic toolface; whereas if it is measured by a 
gyroscopic survey device, it is called gyro toolface. Toolface orientation is 
measured and expressed in this way at low inclinations, generally less than 
5°.
