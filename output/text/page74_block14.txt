An alternative procedure considers the drillstring and the annulus as a “U-
Tube”, as shown in the following figure. It is clear that the sum of 
hydrostatic and frictional pressures in the pipe bore and through the bit 
should equal the sum of hydrostatic and frictional pressures in the annulus. 
Both sums represent the pressure prevailing immediately below the bit.
