One of the primary parameters which directly affects cost analysis is the 
efficiency of the drilling operation, or the optimization of the drilling 
variables. Those operating variables must be varied to achieve the best drill 
rate for each drill bit, each application, and each formation. The two 
primary variables which can be manipulated are the weight-on-bit (WOB) 
and the rotary speed (RPM). Bit hydraulics may have to be manipulated, 
but this should have been accomplished before the bit was tripped into the 
borehole.
