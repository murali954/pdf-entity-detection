A kick that occurs while running casing can lead to extreme problems. 
Stripping the casing to bottom should only be attempted if the guide shoe is 
within a few joints of bottom. If only a short section of casing is in the hole, 
the annular pressure will tend to force it upwards, in which case the casing 
will need to be tied down and filled with drilling fluid immediately. With a 
long section of casing, it becomes more likely that the combination of 
tensional forces, the annulus pressure, and the pressure exerted by the 
BOP's (in subsea wells) will collapse the casing. If it is possible, annular 
preventers should be closed slowly with the choke wide open. Due to the 
small annulus around the relatively large casing, pump rates will tend to be 
slower and the fill up of the casing with kill fluid will take much longer. 
Gas entering the bore hole and casing can continue migrating and may 
complicate pressure calculations. The dangers of lost circulation and an 
underground blowout are increased due to the small annulus. As a last 
resort to gain control, a barite plug may be used or the casing cemented (if 
not at bottom) at the present depth.
