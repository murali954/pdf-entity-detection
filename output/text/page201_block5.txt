The idea of using downhole motors to directly turn the bit is not a new one. 
One of the first commercial motors was turbine driven. The first patent for 
a turbodrill existed in 1873. The USSR focused efforts in developing 
downhole motors as far back as the 1920’s and has continued to use motors 
extensively in their drilling activity. After 1945, the West focused efforts 
more on rotary drilling, but field applications for downhole motors has 
increased spectacularly from the 1980’s onwards.
