Drillstring components located in this “transition zone” may, therefore, 
alternately experience compression and tension. These cyclic oscillations 
can damage downhole tools. A prime example is drilling jars, whose life 
may be drastically shortened if the jars are located in the transition zone. It 
is also important, as previously explained, to know if any drill pipe is being 
run in compression. Therefore it is important to know the location of the 
neutral point.
