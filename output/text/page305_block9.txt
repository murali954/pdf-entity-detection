In INTEQ logging units, a DrillByte EAP program provides a range of pipe 
pulling speeds and their corresponding swab and surge pressures. If 
swabbing does occur, the pipe should be run back to bottom and the 
invading fluid circulated out. Surge pressures, when running into the hole 
(pipe or casing), may be sufficient to exceed the fracture pressure of a weak 
formation. The swab/surge pressure printout should be consulted, and the 
pipe run at a speed that produces surge pressures below the minimum 
fracture pressure. It is important to remember that this is necessary 
anywhere in borehole, as pressures are transmitted to the open hole even 
when the bit is inside the casing.
