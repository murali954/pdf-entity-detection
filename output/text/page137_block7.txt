Hydraulic programs for diamond bits must consider circulation rate and 
pressure loss. There should be sufficient fluid and pressure to cool and 
clean under the bit. Rig hydraulics do not require modification, but a good 
optimum flow rate in the range of 4.5 to 7.0 gallons per minute per square 
inch of hole area is necessary. It may be more or less if the hole or 
operating conditions dictate and if the bit is designed for such conditions.
