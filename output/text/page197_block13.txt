Inner slots are used to drill to the innermost targets (i.e. targets with the 
smallest horizontal distances from the platform) and these wells will be 
given slightly deeper kick-off points. The outer slots are used to drill to 
targets which are furthest from the platform. These wells will be given 
shallow kick-off points and higher build-up rates to keep the maximum 
inclination as low as possible.
