Prepare the final outline from the regrouped data: Using the 
proper format, decide on the order of data presentation, based on; 
order of importance, order of events, etc. Baker Hughes INTEQ 
usually uses an order-of-events arrangement to present the data 
in chronological order. Use only short clauses, sentences or 
phrases in this outline. Indicate where any plots/illustrations will 
be referenced.
