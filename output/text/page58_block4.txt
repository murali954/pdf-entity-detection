The shear stress developed in most drilling fluids is dependent upon the 
duration of shear. A time lag exists between an adjustment of shear rate and 
the stabilization of shear stress. This is due to the breaking up of clay 
particles at high shear rates and the aggregation of clay particles when 
shear rate is decreased, both occurrences take a noticeable length of time.
