If the SICP is greater than the choke line friction pressure loss, it is possible 
to circulate out the kick with conventional techniques and not worry about 
the choke friction pressure loss. However, when the old mud is in the 
choke line, the pressure loss will be equal to that as measured by the slow 
circulating rate. As the kill mud reaches the choke line, the choke line 
friction pressure loss will increase by the ratio of the kill mud density to the 
original mud. For example:
