Each diamond on the bit is continually on bottom, continually doing work, 
therefore the entire area must be continually cleaned and cooled. The bit 
must be kept clean to prevent balling up, and to keep formations exposed to 
the cutting action of the diamonds. The bit must be kept cool; excessive 
heat is one of the diamond's worst enemies. Because of the diamond's 
cutting action, heat is always being generated and a damage can only be 
prevented with adequate flow rates. Other factors being equal, better 
performance may be expected with higher rates of fluid flow.
