Turbulent Flow is the type of flow regime found inside the drill string 
during drilling operations. Since high mud velocities are required to 
achieve turbulent flow, this results in high pressure drops. This type of 
flow is generally not desired in the annulus due to its tendency to cause 
excessive hole erosion and high “equivalent circulating densities”. 
However, turbulent flow can move the mud like a plug, causing the mud to 
move at approximately the same rate. This provides for better hole cleaning 
and is sometimes required on high angle holes. Pressure drop calculations 
for turbulent flow are empirical rather than mathematically derived.
