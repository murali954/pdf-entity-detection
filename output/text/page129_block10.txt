The blanks are then bonded to tungsten carbide studs, which are then press-
fitted into holes on the steel or matrix head of the bit. The cutters are 
positioned in a helical pattern on the bit face so as to have a negative rake, 
an equal distribution of weight-on-bit, and a redundant shearing action. 
The result being an optimal rate of penetration.
