â€¢ Determine the total pressure being exerted at the casing shoe 
(generally the weakest point in the circulating system); the bottom 
of the hole; or any other point (such as a lost circulation zone). After 
this pressure is determined, it is often converted into a mud density 
equivalent and reported as the E.C.D. (Equivalent Circulating 
Density) for that depth.
