Provided there is adequate supervision and communication, and the 
method is completely understood, this can be a very effective way of 
killing a kick. Figure 8-7 illustrates the irregularities in drillpipe pressure 
with kill mud volume, caused by the different densities of the mud. The 
shut-in procedure is the same as that outlined previously. When all the kick 
information has been recorded the pumps are activated slowly until the 
initial circulating pressure has been reached at the designated kill rate. The 
mud should be weighted up as fast as possible, and, as the mud density 
changes in the suction pit, the choke operator is informed. The total pump 
strokes are checked on the drillpipe pressure chart when the new density is 
pumped and the choke is adjusted to suit the new drillpipe conditions.
