One suggestion for an efficient well path for directional wells would be to 
plan the well as a continuous smooth curve, all the way from KOP to 
target. This is the catenary method. A catenary curve is the natural curve 
that a cable, chain or any other line of uniform weight assumes when 
suspended between two points. A similar suspension of drill string would 
also form a catenary curve.
