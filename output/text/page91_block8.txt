A liner is a string of casing that does not reach the surface. They are usually 
“hung” (attached to the intermediate casing using an arrangement of 
packers and slips) from the base of the intermediate casing and reach to the 
bottom of the hole. The major advantage of a liner is the cost of the string is 
reduced, as are running and cementing times. During the course of the well, 
if the liner has to be extended to the surface (making it another string of 
casing), the string attaching the liner to the surface is known as a “tie-back” 
string.
