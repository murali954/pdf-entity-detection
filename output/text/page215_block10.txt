The drive sub is simply the bit connection and bearing shaft. Radial 
bearings protect the shaft from lateral loading and the thrust bearings 
support the downwards hydraulic thrust from mud being pumped through 
the tool and the upward thrust of weight being applied to the bit. 
Theoretically, weight on bit should be applied to equalize the hydraulic 
thrust, which unloads the bearings and prolongs their life.
