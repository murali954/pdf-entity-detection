A manual valve, more commonly referred to as a “full opening safety 
valve”, is usually installed onto the drillpipe after a kick occurs. They 
usually contain a movable ball and when in one position allows flow 
through a hole in the ball, but after turning 90o, shuts off flow completely. 
Rotating the ball is performed with a wrench. These have the advantage 
that wireline tools can be passed through them.
