Tangent or hold sections can prove to be very economical using NDS, 
although NDS performance drilling will not usually match that of straight 
motor performance drilling. Long sections of hole can be drilled faster than 
with conventional rotary assemblies, and corrections can be performed, if 
required, to keep the well on course. Basic design principles include:
