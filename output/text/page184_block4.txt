Sidetracking out of an existing wellbore is another application of 
directional drilling. This is done to bypass an obstruction (“fish”) in the 
original wellbore, to explore the extent of a producing zone in a certain 
sector of a field, or to sidetrack a dry hole to a more promising target. 
Wells are also sidetracked to access more reservoir by drilling a horizontal 
hole section from the existing well bore.
