In general, drilling fluids with a low aniline point can damage the rubber 
stator. As a rule, the nailine point in oil based muds should be around 
150°F (60°C). Usually, this is related to the aromatic content which should 
be equal to or less than 10%. Contact the local supplier if there is any 
doubt.
