The first and still most popular seal is the radial seal (used mainly on the 
sealed roller bearing bits). The radial seal is a circular steel spring encased 
in rubber, which seals against the face of the shank and the face of the 
cone. The newer “O” ring seal is considered the most effective seal. The 
major problem confronting the “O” ring is tolerance, which must be precise 
in order to maintain an effective seal.
