Directional trends are partly related to the direction of the resultant force at 
the bit. It has also been shown that bit tilt (the angle between the bit axis 
and the hole axis) influences the direction of drilling. This is because a drill 
bit is designed to drill parallel to its axis. In rotary assemblies where there 
is a near bit stabilizer, the bit tilt angle is small causing the magnitude of 
side force at the bit to be a key factor.
