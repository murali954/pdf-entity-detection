â€¢ Usually, any formation fluid influx will have a density less than the 
drilling fluid, and will only go into the annulus. In this case, the total 
hydrostatic pressure in the annulus will be less than the hydrostatic 
pressure in the drill string. Since the formation pressure is constant 
for the bottom of the hole (both under the drill string and the 
annulus) the resulting pressures on the drill pipe and casing will 
differ. The surface drillpipe pressure will be less than the annular 
pressure since its hydrostatic is greater.
Exercise 1-9: While drilling at 11,000 ft., with a mud density of 14.4 ppg, 
the well kicked. It was immediately shut in. After the system 
stabilized, the drill pipe pressure was 250 psi. (No influx 
entered the drill string)
