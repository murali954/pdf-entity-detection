The advantage of using this system, instead of the normal method of 
milling a section and sidetracking, is that the operation usually takes less 
time. The main disadvantage is that it gives a sharp dogleg, and as such the 
casing whipstock assembly is not recommended if there is a considerable 
distance to drill below the sidetrack. This is because problems can occur 
when trying to pull stabilizers, etc back into the casing through the 
window. On the other hand, if there is only a short distance to be drilled 
below the sidetrack point, then the casing whipstock is well worth 
considering.
