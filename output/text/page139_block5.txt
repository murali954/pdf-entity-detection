When reaming, the bit weight of about 2,000 to 5,000 pounds maximum 
should be used to avoid fracturing or burning the diamonds, and the rotary 
speed should be moderate (40-60 rpm). If considerable reaming in hard, 
abrasive formations is going to be necessary, the diamond bit should be 
pulled and replaced with a diamond bit specifically designed for reaming.
