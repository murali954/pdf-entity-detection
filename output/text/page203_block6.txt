This is a reverse application of Rene Moineauâ€™s pump principle. The motor 
section consists of a rubber stator and steel rotor. The simple type is a 
helical rotor which is continuous and round. This is the single lobe type. 
The stator is molded inside the outer steel housing and is an elastometer 
compound. The stator will always have one more lobe than the rotor. 
Hence motors will be described as 1/2, 3/4, 5/6 or 9/10 motors.
