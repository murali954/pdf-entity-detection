Mechanical failure or formation breakdown can occur if excessive casing 
pressure is allowed to build up. Mechanical failure at the surface can be 
catastrophic, while formation breakdown can lead to lost circulation, an 
underground blowout and/or possible surface fracturing. A “maximum 
allowable casing pressure” must be determined and if casing pressure rises 
to this maximum level during the initial closing of the well, a decision must 
be made whether or not to shut-in the well.
