Kelly cocks are generally placed at the top and bottom of the kelly. These 
valves may be installed as a permanent part of the drillstring or just when a 
kick occurs. They can be automatic or manually controlled and they consist 
of subs with valves that may be of a spring loaded ball type, a flapper valve 
type, or dart type. The dart acts as a one way valve, with pressure from 
below closing the valve, and pressure from above, opening it. The 
drawback of these valves is that while preventing a blowout up the string 
they prevent the shut-in drillpipe pressure from being monitored.
