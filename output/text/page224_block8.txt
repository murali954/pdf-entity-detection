The principle is that, during the initial spudding and washing process, a 
pocket is produced in the formation opposite the jet nozzle. When high 
WOB is then applied and the drill string rotated, the bit and near bit 
stabilizer work their way into the pocket (the path of least resistance). The 
collars above the NB stabilizer bend and contact the low side of the hole. 
This causes a bending moment about the NB stabilizer which acts as a 
pivot or fulcrum, and the bit is pushed harder into the pocket (i.e. the 
direction in which the large jet nozzle was originally orientated).
