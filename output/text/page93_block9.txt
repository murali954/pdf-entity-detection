The CSG and LCSG have the same basic thread design. The threads have a 
rounded shape, with eight threads per inch. These threads are generally 
referred to as API 8-round. The only difference between the two is that the 
LCSG has a longer thread run-out, which offers more strength for the 
connection. LCSG are very common couplings.
