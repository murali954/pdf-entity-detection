This will consist of a series of bladed stators, fixed to the outer tool housing 
and bladed rotors fixed to the central rotating shaft. Mud flow is deflected 
at a pre-determined angle off the stator blades to hit the rotor blades and 
cause the shaft to rotate. The angle of the blades will affect the torque and 
speed output of the turbine (Figure 5-24).
