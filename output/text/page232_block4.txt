An important aspect of directional drilling is the BHA design which is to 
drill the planned trajectory. In this section we shall concentrate on the basic 
principles used in directional control when drilling with rotary assemblies, 
and the typical assemblies used for each section. The effects of drilling 
parameters (weight-on-bit) and formation (anisotropy) will be considered.
