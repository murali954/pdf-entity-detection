Both swab and surge pressures are caused by moving the drillstring axially, 
and can be calculated using a method similar for calculating annular 
pressure losses. The greatest difficulty is determining the fluid flow 
velocity in the annulus when the pipe is opened-ended, because the 
distribution of flow between the drillstring and annulus cannot be 
determined by a simple method.
