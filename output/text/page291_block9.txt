Though very seldom quantitatively defined in field operations, “f” will 
normally vary between 0.07 (for invert emulsion muds) and 0.40 (for low 
solids native muds). As the mud density increases, the amount of solids 
(barite, sand, bentonite, etc.) also increases, which increases the coefficient 
of friction.
