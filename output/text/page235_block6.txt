Drill Collar Diameter: The stiffness of a drill collar is proportional to the 
fourth power of its diameter. A small reduction in the OD of the drill 
collars used in the fulcrum section considerably increases their limberness 
and hence the rate of build. However, it is not common practice to pick 
drill collar diameter according to build rate requirements. Usually, standard 
collar sizes for the given hole size are used.
