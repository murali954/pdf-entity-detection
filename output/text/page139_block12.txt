Weight should be added as smoothly as possible in 2000 pound increments. 
Observations of penetration rate after each weight increase should be made 
to avoid overloading. As long as the penetration rate continues to increase 
with weight, then weight should be increased. However, if additional 
weight does not increase the penetration rate, then the weight should be 
reduced back 2000 to 3000 pounds, to avoid packing and balling-up of the 
space between the diamonds. Drilling should be continued at this reduced 
weight.
