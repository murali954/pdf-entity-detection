Reactive torque causes a problem for directional drillers when they are 
using a motor and bent sub to deflect the well-bore. The twisting of the 
BHA caused by reactive torque changes the tool face orientation of the 
bent sub. If they are obtaining tool face orientation from single shot 
surveys, the directional driller has to estimate how much turn to the left 
they will get due to reactive torque. They will set the tool face that number 
of degrees round to the right of the desired tool face, so that the reactive 
torque will bring it back to the setting required while drilling.
