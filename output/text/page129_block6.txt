General Electric, recognizing that drag bits had advantages (most notably 
the absence of moving parts and the efficiency of shear cutting) began in 
the early 70's the testing of new cutting structures for these drag bits. Since 
their introduction into the oilfields in 1976, the cutting structure of the 
polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) has made the drag bit competitive 
with the conventional roller cone and diamond bits.
