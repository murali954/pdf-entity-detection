For some fluids the relationship is linear (i.e., if the shear-stress is doubled 
then the shear-rate will also double, or if the circulation rate is doubled then 
the pressure required to pump the fluid will double). Fluids such as this are 
known as “Newtonian fluids”. Examples of Newtonian fluids are water, 
glycerine and diesel. The Newtonian fluid model is defined by the 
following relationship:
