During initial spudding and early drilling, a shallow underground blowout 
is difficult to control and may easily result in the loss of the rig, hence, an 
effort must be made to divert the flow away from the rig. Care must be 
taken to ensure that the well is not shut in until the diverter lines are 
opened.
