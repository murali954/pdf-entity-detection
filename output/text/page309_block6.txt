When the drill pipe is being removed, the hole must be topped off with 
mud regularly. If the hole does not take the same volume of mud to replace 
the volume of pipe withdrawn, it is an indication that formation fluid is 
displacing mud near the bottom of the hole and the well is kicking. It is 
common while drilling offshore to continually circulate through a trip tank 
while tripping out. Careful monitoring of the decrease in trip tank volume, 
against the calculated pipe displacement is required so discrepancies can be 
noticed. In INTEQ logging units, the trip monitor program provides 
comparison volumes for every stand pulled. Alternatively, a “trip condition 
log” provides a summary of hole conditions and fill-up during trips.
