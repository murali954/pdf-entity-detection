The only real advantage of turbines is that they can operate at higher 
temperatures than PDMs. Also turbines DO NOT have a dump valve. 
Years ago, short deviation turbines could handle higher flow rates than 
PDMs, but this is no longer the case. Nowadays, it is quite rare to use a 
turbine with a bent sub.
