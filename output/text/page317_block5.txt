When kill mud reaches the bit, it is good practice to shut-in the well. The 
drillpipe pressure should fall to zero; if it doesn't, a few more barrels 
should be pumped to ensure that the kill mud has reached the bit. If the 
drillpipe pressure is still greater than zero when the pump is stopped and 
the choke closed, the kick control figures should be rechecked. When 
satisfied, pumping is restarted, but now the drillpipe pressure is kept 
constant as the kill mud displaces the mud in the annulus. When the kick 
fluids and original mud have been displaced, the choke should be wide 
open. The pump should be shut down and both SIDP & SICP should read 
zero. If so, the well should then be observed for flow. The kick is now 
killed and mud should be circulated to condition the hole, and at the same 
time the trip margin (if any) should be added.
