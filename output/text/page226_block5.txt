The bent sub acts as the pivot of a lever and the bit is pushed sideways as 
well as downwards. This sideways component of force at the bit gives the 
motor a tendency to drill a curved path, provided there is no rotation of the 
drill string. The degree of curvature (dogleg severity) depends on the bent 
sub angle and the OD of the motor, bent sub and drill collars in relation to 
the diameter of the hole. It also depends on the length of the motor.
