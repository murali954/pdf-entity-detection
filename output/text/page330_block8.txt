Annular preventer: 
Commonly referred to as a bag type or spherical preventer, it 
is designed to stop flow from the well using a steel-ribbed 
packing element that contracts around the drill pipe. The 
packer will conform to the shape of the pipe that is in the 
bore hole. It is operated hydraulically, utilizing a piston 
acting on the packer. Once closed they utilize the upward 
well pressure to maintain their closed position. These 
preventers are available for a variety of working pressures, 
ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 psi. While these preventers can 
be used without pipe in the hole, the life of the packing 
element will be reduced by the stress of closing upon itself.
