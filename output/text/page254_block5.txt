The nature and hardness of the rock being drilled can have a pronounced 
influence on directional tendencies, although in many cases the importance 
may be exaggerated. A main point is whether the rock is isotropic or 
anisotropic. An isotropic rock is one which has the same properties, or 
behaves in the same way, regardless of its direction. Most sandstones are 
isotropic. Conversely, anisotropic rocks, such as shales, do not have the 
same properties in all directions.
