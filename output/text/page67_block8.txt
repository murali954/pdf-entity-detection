The first is the flow rate range. As discussed earlier, the flow pattern in 
the annulus should be laminar, therefore the upper limit for the flow rate is 
a Reynolds Number of 2000. The highest velocity in the annulus will be 
around the collars, and this velocity can be determined by calculating the 
“critical velocity” over that section. In addition, running the pumps at that 
upper range is not always advisable because there will be more wear and 
tear on the pumps and much more fuel consumption.
