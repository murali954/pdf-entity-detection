The initial recommended hydraulic pressure for closing most types of 
annular preventers is 1,500 psi. Once the packer is closed, the pressure 
should be reduced slightly to reduce damage to the rubber portion of the 
packer. One special feature of the annular preventer is that it will allow 
stripping operations to be carried out while maintaining pressure as the tool 
joints pass through the preventer. When stripping-in, the tool joints should 
be moved slowly through the preventer to avoid damage to the packing 
element.
