Similarly, procedures which through its implementation, places high 
stresses on the wellbore should not be used in preference to others which 
impose lower stresses on the wellbore. Reference to the above points 
illustrates that the one circulation method places the minimum stresses on 
both the wellbore and surface equipment. When a kick is circulated out the 
maximum stresses occur very early in the circulation - particularly in deep 
wells with higher pressures. At any point in the borehole, the maximum 
stress is imposed on the formation when the top of the kick fluid reaches 
that point.
