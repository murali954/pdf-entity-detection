The first circulation of the Drillerâ€™s Method is performed using the original 
mud. The choke is opened slightly, at the same time the pumps are started 
up to the kill rate. When the pumps have reached kill rate, the choke is 
manipulated to maintain the Initial Circulating Pressure (ICP) on the 
drillpipe. As the kick fluids approach the surface, the annular pressure will 
rise drastically if the kick is gas. If the kick is saltwater the annular pressure 
will drop slightly.
