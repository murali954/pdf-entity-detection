A recent development in connecting rod assembly technology has been the 
utilization of flexible steel or titanium “flex rods” (Figure 5-22b). While 
flex rods are limited by the degree of allowable lateral bending, they have 
the advantage of low maintenance, since they do not require lubricants or 
rubber sleeves. Flex rods are now standard on most smaller Navi-Drills. 
One recent approach has been to mount the flex rod inside the hollow rotor 
of a short, high torque steerable PDM, rather than connecting it to the 
bottom of the rotor. By connecting a long flex rod to the inside of the top 
end of the rotor and extending it through the rotor, to connect to the top of 
the drive sub assembly, the overall rate of bend is decreased due to its 
increased length.
