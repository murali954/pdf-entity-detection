constant, but varies to some maximum or minimum with the duration of 
shear.) If the apparent viscosity decreases with flow time, the fluid is 
termed “Thixotropic”. Once flow has ceased, a thixotropic fluid will show 
an increase in apparent viscosity. When apparent viscosity increases with 
flow time, the fluid is “Rheopectic”.
