Usually, thrust bearings are made up of rubber discs (Figure 5-24) which 
are non-rotating (being fixed to the outer housing of the tool) and rotating 
steel discs attached to the central rotating shaft. Long bearing sections 
known as cartridges are used for long life in tangent or straight hole drilling 
sections. These are changeable at the rigsite. If the bearings wear past the 
maximum point, considerable damage can be inflicted as the steel rotors 
will crash into the stators below.
