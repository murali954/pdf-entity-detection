There are essentially three types of jet nozzles used in tri-cone bits. 
Shrouded nozzle jets provide maximum protection against retainer ring 
erosion, excessive turbulence or extended drilling periods. Standard jet 
nozzles are easier to install and are recommended for situations where 
erosion is not a problem. Air jet nozzles (see above) are used on bits 
designated for drilling with air or gas.
