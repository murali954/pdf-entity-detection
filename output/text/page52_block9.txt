This is measured by use of a 200 mesh sand screen set. A measuring tube is 
filled with mud and water and shaken vigorously. The mixture is then 
poured over the 200 mesh sieve and washed clean with water. The sand is 
then washed into the measuring tube and measured in percent. This will 
give an indication as to the effectiveness of the mechanical solids control 
equipment.
