The second factor is the operating pressure of the mud pumps. Most mud 
pumps can produce the required pressure with little problem. However, 
because of the various components associated with the surface system 
(standpipe, rotary hose, pulsation dampener, etc.) the maximum surface 
pressure is usually limited to some value less than the maximum rated 
pump pressure.
