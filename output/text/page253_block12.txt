When using a fulcrum (build) assembly, reducing the collar OD will 
dramatically increase the build tendency, because the collars will be more 
limber and will bend more. Another factor is the clearance between the 
outside of the drill collars and the wall of the hole. The greater the 
clearance, the more the collars can bend before they contact the low side of 
the hole. Once the collars contact the low side of the hole, further increases 
in WOB will have only a marginal effect on build rate by moving the 
contact point down the hole.
