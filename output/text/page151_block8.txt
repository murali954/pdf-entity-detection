Note: The formula above for hookload does not take into 
account axial drag. Hookload, as determined in the 
formula above is the approximate static surface hookload 
that would be displayed by the weight indicator in a 
vertical hole with no drag, excluding the weight of the 
traveling block, drill line etc.
