The gauge length of a PDC bit can significantly affect the build rate in a 
rotary assembly. A bit with a short gauge length can result in a build rate 
greater than that would be expected with a tri-cone bit. On the other hand, a 
longer gauge stabilizes the bit, which tends to reduce the rate of build. The 
low WOB typically used with PDC bits can also reduce the build rate, since 
collar flexure decreases with decreasing WOB. When used with packed 
assemblies, longer gauged PDC bits seem to aid in maintaining inclination 
and direction due to the increased stabilization at the bit.
