The Fann viscometer consists of an outer rotating sleeve and an inner bob. 
When the outer sleeve is rotated at a known speed, torque is transmitted 
through the mud to the bob. The bob is connected to a spring and dial, 
where the torque is measured. The shear rate is the rotational speed of the 
sleeve and the shear stress is the stress (torque) applied to the bob, 
measured as deflection units on the instrument dial. These measurement 
values are not true units and need to be converted.
