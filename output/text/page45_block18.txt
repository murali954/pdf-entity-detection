We can see that control of the solids will give us control over our PV! This 
leads to “Why are we controlling the solids?” Since the viscosity of the 
mud is one of the principal factors contributing to the carrying capacity of 
the mud, the suspension of weighting materials, and pressure surges 
applied to the formation through frictional pressures in the annulus, it is 
obvious that increased solids will increase these annular pressures (and 
may increase the mud density), so a balance must be found in which the
