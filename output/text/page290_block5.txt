The force holding the drillstring against the borehole wall can be calculated 
very quickly. This force will have to be exceeded to free the drillstring. If 
the force is greater than the pull of the blocks or the tensile strength of the 
drillstring, the general practice is to add some compound (i.e. diesel, “black 
magic”, etc.) to the drilling fluid to reduce the friction between the 
drillstring and filter cake.
