The neutral point is usually defined as the point in the drillstring where the 
axial stress changes from compression to tension. The location of this 
neutral point depends on the weight-on-bit and the buoyancy factor of the 
drilling fluid. In practice, since the WOB fluctuates, the position of the 
neutral point changes. It is therefore quite common to refer to a “transition 
zone” as the section where axial stress changes from compression to 
tension.
