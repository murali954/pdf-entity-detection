In its most basic form a drilling fluid is composed of a liquid (either water 
or oil) and some sort of viscosifying agent. If nothing else is added, 
whenever the hydrostatic pressure is greater than the formation pore 
pressure (and the formation is porous and permeable) a portion of the fluid 
will be flushed into the formation. Since excessive filtrate can cause 
borehole problems, some sort of filtration control additive is generally 
added. In order to provide enough hydrostatic pressure to balance abnormal 
pore pressures, the density of the drilling fluid is increased by adding a 
weight material (generally barite).
