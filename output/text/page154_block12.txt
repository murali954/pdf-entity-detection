The previous discussion was restricted to the simple case when the higher 
grade pipe is totally in the vertical portion of the well. If the higher grade 
pipe is used through a build-up section, the calculation becomes more 
difficult. A rough approximation could be obtained by treating each stand 
length as a straight section of hole and using the average inclination of that 
course length. The weight this exerts along the borehole is found from:
