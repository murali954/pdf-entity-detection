The standard cost-per-foot formula makes no allowance for the variations 
in operating costs when comparing runs of greatly different lengths. These 
variations stem from safety factors (working hazards are greater during 
trips), time for rig maintenance, need for additional mud treatment prior to 
trips, severity of operating conditions (more WOB requires more collars), 
and hole conditions which may be aggravated during trips. Nevertheless, it 
is the best approach we have for a generalized comparison, and lends itself 
well to the need for a prior analysis to determine when to run a higher 
priced bit. Those factors not included in the formula invariably favor using 
the bit which makes the most hole.
