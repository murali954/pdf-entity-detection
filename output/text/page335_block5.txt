The Low Choke procedure consists of circulating and weighting up the 
mud at its maximum density, while maintaining the maximum allowable 
casing pressure on the choke. The influx will continue to flow into the well 
until the mud has been sufficiently weighted and this may take several 
circulations. The required kill mud density will not be known as the 
drillpipe pressure is not allowed to stabilize upon initial closure. After 
some heavier fluid has been circulated, the well may be shut-in and an 
estimate of the required kill mud density can be made.
