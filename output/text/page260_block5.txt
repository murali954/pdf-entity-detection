Several methods exist for continuously controlled directional drilling using 
“steerable downhole motors”. These methods are based upon tilting the 
axis of the bit with respect to the axis of the hole to creating a side force at 
the bit. If the drill string, and the body of the motor, is rotated at the 
surface, the bit will tend to drill straight ahead. However, if the drill string 
is not rotated from surface then bit will drill a curved path determined by 
the orientation of the side force or the tilt of the bit axis.
