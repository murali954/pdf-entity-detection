Typically, the rate of penetration will increase when switching from the 
oriented mode to the rotary mode. As a rule of thumb, the tilt angle selected 
should theoretically produce a minimum of 1.25 times the maximum 
dogleg severity required for the well plan. Directional drillers must keep in 
mind that the TGDS (Theoretical Geometric Dogleg Severity) assumes that 
tool face orientation is constant. In practice this is difficult to do, especially 
in high torque applications. As a result of a constantly changing tool face 
orientation, the actual rate of change could be less than expected.
