Having calculated the pressure losses for circulating up both the riser and 
choke line, it is necessary to decide which to use in calculating the initial 
and final circulating pressures. Although the circulating of a kick will be 
done through the choke, the pressure used to establish the ICP and FCP is 
that derived from the slow circulation up the riser, not the choke!
