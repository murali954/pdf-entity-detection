the alternatives include using the low choke pressure procedure, pumping a 
barite pill, pumping cement, or allowing the well to flow until pressure is 
reduced. If the surface equipment rating will not be exceeded and 
fracturing to the surface is not likely, consideration can be given to shutting 
in the well and allowing formation breakdown to occur.
