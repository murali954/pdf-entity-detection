This is usually a more effective method of killing a kick than the driller's 
method, if time is not a prime concern (Figure 8-5). Kill mud is pumped 
into the drillpipe as soon as it is ready, which tends to reduce the high 
annular pressures associated with gas kicks. The same shut-in procedures 
are used as outlined in the previous section.
