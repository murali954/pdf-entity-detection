Diamond core bits were introduced into the oilfield in the early 1920's and 
were used to core extremely hard formations. These early diamond bits 
were very expensive, costing about twenty times the price of the roller bits. 
Since performance was barely economical for coring, very little 
consideration was given to diamond bits as a drilling tool.
