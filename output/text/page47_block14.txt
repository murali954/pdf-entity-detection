Broken bond valences may be neutralized by adsorption of 
certain negative ions at the edge of the clay particles. These 
residual valences are almost totally satisfied by chemicals such 
as tannins, lignins, lignosulfonates and complex phosphates. The 
attractive forces are satisfied by chemicals, and the clay's natural 
negative charge remains, so that the particles repel each other.
