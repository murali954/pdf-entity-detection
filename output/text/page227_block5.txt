Reactive torque is created by the drilling fluid pushing against the stator. 
Since the stator is bonded to the body of the motor, the effect of this force 
is to twist the motor and BHA anti-clockwise. As weight-on-bit is 
increased, the drilling torque created by the motor increases, and reactive 
torque increases in direct proportion. Thus a reasonable, although 
simplistic, way to view this is that the clockwise drilling torque generated 
at the bit is the “action” and the counter-clockwise torque on the motor 
housing is the “reaction”. The reactive torque at the motor is equal to the 
drilling torque.
