As stated earlier, when the drillstring is rotated, the component of sliding 
friction (drag) is small and may be compensated for by using a safety factor 
in BHA weight calculations. Drillstring friction for rotary assemblies will 
mainly affect torque values. When the drillstring is not rotated (a steerable 
motor system in the oriented mode) axial drag can become very significant 
and drillstring friction should be evaluated.
