Bit life is controlled by the cutting structure. As stated earlier, the PDC 
cutting elements provide a self-sharpening edge with the wear resistance of 
diamonds. This combination is very effective in soft to medium formations 
such as shale, chalks, limestones, clays, salts and anhydrite. These 
formations have been drilled at excellent penetration rates with weights 
between 1000 and 2500 pounds per inch of bit diameter and rotary speeds 
of 85 to 140 rpm. Economic performance has also been achieved with 
rotary speeds of 750 rpm and weights of 1000 pounds per inch of bit 
diameter using downhole motors.
