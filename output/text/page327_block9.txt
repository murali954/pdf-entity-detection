However, this will impose excessive pressures on the entire well system. 
The 300 psi read on the casing pressure gauge is only valid while shut-in. 
Once fluid movement occurs, this gauge is reading choke pressure - not 
casing pressure. To read casing pressure while circulating, the kill line 
must be used as a casing monitor. In this example, an extra 300 psi would 
have been imposed on the drillpipe side and the casing side.
