All cement is manufactured in essentially the same way. Calcareous and 
argillaceous materials (containing iron and aluminum oxides) are finely 
ground and mixed in correct proportions, either in a dry condition (dry 
processing) or with water (water processing). The mixture is then fed into 
the upper end of a sloping kiln at a uniform rate. The kiln is heated to 
temperatures from 2600o to 3000oF. As the mixture falls to the lower end, 
the mixture melts and chemical reactions occur between the raw materials. 
When the mixture cools, it is called “clinker”. The clinker is then ground 
with a controlled amount of gypsum (1.5 to 3.0% by weight), to form 
portland cement.
