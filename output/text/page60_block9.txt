Once passed the surface equipment, the fluid will flow through the 
drillstring. In hydraulic calculations, these parts of the circulating system 
are considered circular pipes. In typical field operations, fluid velocities are 
in the order of 1000 ft/min (300 m/min). At such velocities, the fluid is in 
turbulent flow.
