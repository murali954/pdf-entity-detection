Turn the pipe to achieve the desired tool face orientation. This 
orientation should include an allowance for the anticipated 
reactive torque. A rough rule of thumb is to allow 10° /1000' for 
lower torque motors (Mach 2) and 20° /1000' for higher torque 
motors (Mach 1), but remember the reactive torque obtained is a 
function of WOB and differential pressure across the motor.
