This model fits the actual flow properties more closely, although at low 
shear rates, it will predict slightly low shear stresses. The model describes a 
fluid in which the shear stress increases as a function of shear rate, raised to 
some power. As mentioned earlier, the equation for the Power Law model 
is:
