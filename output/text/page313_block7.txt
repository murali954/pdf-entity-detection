The one and two circulation methods are simple in both theory and 
execution. Choice between the two is dependent upon the other points 
(time factor, surface pressures, downhole stresses, and so forth), and any 
other limitations caused by the situation. The concurrent kill method is 
relatively complex in operation and its reliability may be reduced through 
its intricacy. Because of this, many operators have discontinued its use.
