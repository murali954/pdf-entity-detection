This is a short tool which has a set number of stages and its bearing section 
entirely within one housing. That is, it is not a sectional tool and will be 
typically less than 30 feet long. It is designed for short runs to kick off or 
correct a directional well, using a bent sub as the deflection device. 
Steerable turbodrills do exist and will be discussed later.
