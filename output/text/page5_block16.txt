At the end of each chapter there will be “Self-Check” exercises, which are designed to 
assist you in understanding the information covered in the chapter. It is recommended that 
you do not proceed until you are confident that you fully understand the concepts, 
calculations, and applications of the chapter's subject matter. Direct any questions you may 
have to the Technical Training Department or a local technical expert.
