Maximizing Hpb involves minimizing Hpc, or in other words, the lowest 
flow rate and the highest pump pressure will result in the highest Hpb. 
However, the “lowest flow rate” will usually result in inadequate bottom 
hole cleaning. To compensate for this, bottom hole pressure can be 
increased by using smaller jet nozzles.
