In the mud system, we have solids that are an integral part of the mud 
(bentonite, starch, CMC, etc.) and solids that are undesirable (sand, 
limestone, dolomite, etc.). As the mud density is increased, by the addition 
of barite or hematite (more solids), the PV will automatically increase. The 
PV is also a function of the viscosity of the fluid phase of the mud (as 
temperature rises, the viscosity of water decreases, and the PV will 
decrease).
