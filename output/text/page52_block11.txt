A retort is used to determine the quantity of liquids and solids in a drilling 
fluid. A measured sample of fluid is heated until the liquid portion is 
vaporized. The vapors are passed through a condenser and measured as a 
percentage by volume. The solids are then calculated by subtracting the 
total from 100.
