The first hydraulic features incorporated into drilling tools dated back to 
the original use of hollow drillpipe with direct circulation of drilling fluids. 
As the first fishtail bits became popular, around the turn of the century, 
circulation though water courses was used for the first time. The first 
rolling cutter rock bits of 1909 introduced a central water course system 
which directed fluid discharge towards the cutters.
