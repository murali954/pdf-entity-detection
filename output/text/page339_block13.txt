Loss of fluid returns will lower the hydrostatic head of the drilling fluid in 
the wellbore, thereby inducing a kick. The influx fluid will then flow to the 
surface or into the zone of lower pressure. Lost circulation can occur in 
naturally occurring fractured, vuggy, cavernous, sub-normally pressured or 
pressure depleted formations. Induced losses can occur from mechanical 
fracturing due to pressure surges while breaking circulation. In all cases of 
lost circulation, attempts should be made to keep the hole full. The hole can 
be filled with either light drilling fluid or water. A record of the amount of 
fluid pumped should be made.
