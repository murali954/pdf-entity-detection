The journal angle (Figure 3-1) is the angle at which the journal is mounted, 
relative to a horizontal plane. This mounting moves the cutting elements 
(cones) outside the support members. The journal angle also controls the 
cutter profile or pattern it drills, and it affects the amount of cutter action on 
the bottom of the hole.
