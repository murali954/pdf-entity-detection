Similarly, for an inclined section of the well where the inclination is 
constant, the weight acting along hole will be the air-weight of the pipe 
multiplied by the cosine of the average inclination. Notice again that in this 
particular calculation we do not use a buoyancy factor. This is because 
although the entire drillstring is subject to a buoyancy force, that force is 
acting on the lower portion of the string and affects the weight pulling 
down on the top joint of lower grade pipe from below, but not the weight of 
the joints of higher grade pipe at the top of the string.
