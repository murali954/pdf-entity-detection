Extended cement slurries are used to reduce the hydrostatic pressure on 
weak formations and to decrease the cost of slurries. Extenders work by 
allowing the addition of more water to the slurry to lighten the mixture and 
to keep the solids from separating. These additives change the thickening 
times, compressive strengths and water loss.
